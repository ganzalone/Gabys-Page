Working with rules

  

Enacted law

-express rules

-statutes, rules, regulations, executive orders

  

Common law

-express rules- single judicial opinion

-synthesized rules- from multiple opinions

  

Express rule- break down to elements

Synthesized- elements to consolidate as a rule

  

Express rules process:

Break rule into parts-

-elements

-casual term

-result

-exceptions (if any)

  

Analyze parts separately

Put rule back together

  

Rules: standard + consequence + exceptions

  

Standard MUST be met in order for consequence to occur

Exceptions BYPASS the consequence

  

Options- disjunctive

Requirements- conjunctive

  
  

Module 5 notes

 Recap

Constitution is founding document

3 branches of govt equal via checks and balances

Judicial branch has 3 tiers

Cases may go to tier 2 and 3 at different points during the process in tier one

Advocates in cases work with rules then apply to facts

Rules may be express or synthesized

Express may be enacted or common law 

Express rules are stated exactly, we break them into elements and apply them 

Synthesized are only common law

  

Types of Reasoning

To apply a rule you may use deductive or analogical reasoning 

Deductive reasoning is used for general rules

Analogical rules used for more complex rules or rules with gaps

Ex: deductive- BAC rules ( you are either at or below legal limit)

  

Is socrates mortal?

  

Rule (major premise)(general statement in law) (rule is given to us and we accept as true)- all men are mortal

  

Fact (minor premise) (in law is considered “relevant fact”) (specific rather than general in rule)- socrates is a man

  

Conclusion (specific, combines law and facts)- socrates is mortal

  

Express common law rule w analogical reasoning

Generally, common law rule is common law because it required further analogical reasoning

  

Is ptolemais mortal?

  

All men are mortal; no rule for women (major premise) 

  

Socrates (man) is mortal

-living being

-susceptible to disease

-will eventually die

  

Ptolemais (woman) is like Socrates (minor premise is the factual 

Analogy, comparison, distinction)

-living being

-susceptible to disease

-will eventually die

  

Therefore, Ptolemais is mortal (conclusion, logical)

  
  

What if rule is not express?

Derive rule trough observation and inference

Process of inductive reasoning

  

Goes from specific to general as opposed to general to specific

  

Number of examples does not determine whether a rule can be derived 

Number of examples determines confidence in rule

  

inductive reasoning for missing rule

  

Is socrates mortal?

  

Rule: ???

  

Facts: Socrates is a man

  

Conclusion:

  
  

-   Use minor premise to draw rule and then conclusion
    

  

Look at several specific cases and thus derive a general rule

Plato, Aristotle and Phaedrus are all men AND mortal

  

Thus we can infer that socrates, a man, is mortal - SYNTHESIZING RULE W INDUCTIVE REASONING

Once rule is synthesized, plug into deductive reasoning model

  

Rule- could be express or synthesized

Origin of rules does not impact facts

Nor does it impact conclusion

  
  

Receiving a case

Review the facts

Use inductive reasoning if necessary to derive synthesized rule

OR discover express rule

Apply to facts using deductive reasoning or analogical

Advise client based upon conclusion

Provide analysis to judge

Judge will make decision if fair rule is from facts 

Decision comes that perhaps changes law, fills in gap, etc.

Ruling becomes part of body of law

Cycle repeats

  
  
  

A judicial opinion 

  

Case methods:

Insight into substance of law (what law is) 

How law develops (how law has changed over time)

Insight into legal/analytical process

Express- enacted and common law 

enacted includes: Constitution, statutes, executive orders, and regulations 

*both language and substance is important 

*in common law language is not as important 

  

Process for rule 

-language of the rule

-identify standard consequence and any exceptions 

  

Standard- what triggers a consequence 

Consequence- result of meeting consequences 

Exception- negation of consequence despite standard being met 

  

Synthesized- only common law 1 

  

1.Standard triggers consequence once criteria is met

2. standard does not trigger consequence if one or more of criteria not met 

3. standard triggers consequence but exception negates consequence 

  

*factors are considerations 

  

(Chicken + lettuce + salad 

chicken and lettuce are standard, salad is consequence 

if just chicken it's just chicken = no consequence even though 1 standard was met 

exception: chicken and lettuce wrapped in bread is a sandwich )

Rule explanation is a way of using analogical reasoning

  

Rule explanation

Thesis sentence

Legally relevant facts of the case

Counts rationale and holding

  

Thesis sentence should relate to one or more factors because the purpose of rule explanation is to explain how the courts use those factors

  

Information in the interior boxes is legally relevant facts

Courts rationale and holding = restrict to what court said about legally relevant facts & how they are being discussed
