"the moving party is ready your honor"

## Good evening and may it please the court,
My name is Gabrielle Anzalone and I am representing the appellant Ramsay Bolton, CEO of Kingslist. Would the court like a recitation of the facts?

## Today we ask this court to reverse the decision of the district court
, and align its reasoing with the many other circuit courts who have found  indeed that a website is not a public place of accomodation pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

the decision by the district court should be reversed for the foregoing reasons:

1. being that **The plain and unambiguous meaning of the terms of the ADA does not support websites as places of public accommodation**

and 
2. That numerous circuit courts have found that a website is not a public place of accommodation in cases where the plaintiff failed to assert a nexus to a physical location…**


## POINT ONE
Examples of public places of accommodation are enumerated within the statute 42 U.S.C.§ 12182(a),

including (but not limited to) bakeries, laundromats, shopping centers, and hospitals. 

In other words, it must either be a brick-and-mortar building, or a nexus between the intangible entity and a physical location must exist. Only at this point would it be considered a place of public accommodation, and thus suffice as a breach of the ADA

In Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp., the Third Circuit court held that “the plain meaning of Title III is that a public accommodation is a place ... ." 

"it is all of the services which the public accommodation offers, not all services which the lessor of the public accommodation offers[,] which fall within the scope of Title III.” 

In Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.,, another case by the third circuit, the court gave this analogy To help digest this concept, that “ a bookstore cannot discriminate against disabled people in granting access, but need not assure that the books are available in Braille as well as print.” 

In our case, the access was sufficiently provided by the attendant at the call center, assisting Mr. Snow in placing bids. Kingslist's liability stops at the assurance of making its website compatible with the Winter is Coming software. 


In its analysis of Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 

the Ninth Circuit held that an insurance company administering an employer-provided disability plan is not a place of public accommodation.

The court additionally introduces the principle of noscitur a sociis, which requires that the phrase, “place of public accommodation,” be interpreted within the context provided by the accompanying words. 

The context within the particular case encourages that a connection between the good or service denied and an actual physical place is required.




## POINT TWO 

A crucial part was missing from the lower court’s analysis, and that is the element of a nexus being present. In order for a website to be considered a public accommodation, a nexus between the website and a physical location must be present.

There are NUMEROUS circuits with cases similar to our own who have found that a nexus must be present. 

the case that mimics ours most is In Earll v. Ebay, Inc., A Ninth Circuit Court case. Here, the court agreed with this interpretation, considering the term “place of public accommodation” to require the same element of a nexus to a physical location. In the case of Earll, the court said that “Because eBay's services are not connected to any “actual, physical place[ ],” eBay is not subject to the ADA”

The services that eBay provides are very comparable to that of Kingslist, as both are auction websites not attached to an actual, physical location. 

1. In Parker v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., the Sixth Circuit court held that "a public accommodation is a physical place.” Parker v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 121 F.3d 1006. They determined that the communication link between a credit card processing terminal and the issuer was determined not to be a public accommodation under the unambiguous meaning of the ADA. Id. at 1006.
2. The third circuit said in Peoples v. Discover Fin. Servs. which said that “the communication between a credit card processing terminal and the issuer was not a public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA.”**
3.  the Eleventh Circuit court  ruled in Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., that a website was not a place of public accommodation. 
4. The 9th circuit found AGAIN in Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp that an insurance policy administered by the insurance company was not a good provided by the insurance company's physical office.

This is very similar to our own case in regards to Kingslist. John Snow’s communication with the call center fails to establish a nexus to a physical location as the goods that he was seeking to obtain was not provided by the call center which he was in contact with. 



**BUT WHAT ABOUT AN APP/INTERNET QUESTION!!!!**
In stark contrast to that of Earll or Weyer is the Robles case. In Robles v. Domino's Pizza,
“Domino's website and app facilitate access to the goods and services of a place of public accommodation— Domino's physical restaurants.” 
The communications that a consumer may have with the restaurant’s website create a nexus to a physical location, as a product of that communication is the receipt of goods and services from a physical restaurant. Id. at 899. 

The court makes note that “[the website and app] are means of ordering Domino's products to be picked up at or delivered from THE PHYSICAL Domino's restaurants.” 

This is unlike our case, as the appellee’s contact with the Kingslist employee is not connected to a physical location which would hold, package, ship or deliver the goods he is seeking.

[[Mr. Snow did make contact and received assistance from the employee at the call center, the call center does not provide sufficient and pervasive contact enough to establish a nexus between Kingslist and a physical location.

[[Kingslist.com is an auction website, from which listings for various goods are put up and bids are placed. There is no physical location of Kingslist, nor is it 





## AT MINUTE AND  A HALF

my time is about to expire your honor, may i briefly conclude?

In conclusion, 

the langauge within the ADA clearly defines a public place of accomodation as a physical location. As such, we ask the court to reverse the decision made by the district court and follow the precedent set by other circuit courts.



## REBUT

CONGRESSIONAL MEANING:

**In [Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Co.](https://plus.lexis.com/api/document/collection/cases/id/4DD2-F630-0038-X22T-00000-00?cite=385%20F.3d%201324&context=1530671), the Eleventh Circuit court acknowledges the impact of the internet on Title III. However, they state that the case is not the proper vehicle to address legal issues, and abide by the precedent that a nexus must be established.**

if Congress wanted it in the plain meaining of the statute they would've added it when they amended the ADA 

When other courts have determined this statute to have clear and unambiguous meaning, as well as cases in existence such as  **Earll v. Ebay, Inc** that mirror our exact fact pattern, to once again dive into this issue is redundant. This court should follow that circuit's reasoning and uphold that precedent. 

In its reasoning, the court stated its agreement with the Eleventh Circuit, when it held in Rendon v. Valleycrest Prods. that discrimination in the context of public accommodations includes "intangible barriers . . . that restrict a disabled person's ability  to  enjoy  the  defendant  entity's  goods,  services  and privileges.” 294 F.3d at 1283. 

However, the Eleventh Circuit court also ruled in Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., that a website was not a place of public accommodation. 

## rebuttal FIXED

a few points, the appelee's argument appears to hinge strongly on 

ADA PROMISED MORE, CONGRESSIONAL MEANING AND INTENTION
the american with disabilities act amendments act of 2008
and within this act is stated that it was amendment in so that statutes "generally shall not require extensive analysis"

*if intention is clear, and the language is unambiguous, then the opposing council should be in agreeance that a public place of accomodation is a physical location

## full and equal enjoyment- 
In Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp., the Third Circuit court held that “the plain meaning of Title III is that a public accommodation is a place ... ." 

"it is all of the services which the public accommodation offers, not all services which the lessor of the public accommodation offers[,] which fall within the scope of Title III.” 

In Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.,, another case by the third circuit, the court gave this analogy To help digest this concept, that “ a bookstore cannot discriminate against disabled people in granting access, but need not assure that the books are available in Braille as well as print.” 

- AMAZON DOES HAVE PHYSICAL WAREHOUSES, stores and locations connected to physical stores.
