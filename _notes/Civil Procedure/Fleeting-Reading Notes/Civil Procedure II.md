Jurisdiction -- legislative jurisdiction
      |
Judicial jurisdiction --personal jurisdiction (due process)
      |
      subject matter jurisdiction (article III)

- full faith & credit clause (IV) # states supporting states
- supremacy clause (VI)

- why file in federal court?- typically faster process, different civil procedures
- sources of law: 
	- constitution- articles & amendments
	- federal statutes- united states code (USC) *passed by legislative branch*
	- fed rules of civil procedure- (FRCP) -since 1938 have governed civil proceedings in US district courts. renewed & approved by supreme court & congress
	- case law- supreme court & lower fed court cases 

title 28- judiciary & judicial procedure code

what court? - subject matter jurisdiction
what state? - personal jurisdiction (fair & due process)

state courts- general jurisdiction
fed court- exclusive jurisdiction
fed & state court- shared jurisdiction

what is a motion?- document filed with court asking them to take action!

CITIZENSHIP OF INDIVIDUALS = **DOMICILE**
a) a person always **has one- and only one-** domicile;
b) an infant acquires a domicile at birth, which is almost always the domicile of her parents;
c) in order to **change her domicile**, a person must both
- **establish residence** in a new state and
- have the **intent to remain** in that state

the **residence and the intent to remain must exist at the same time**, even if only temporarily. (no floating intentions)

#### Federal Jurisdiction
-created after Civil War to protect newly created federal civil rights:
- civil rights acts of 1866, 1868, 1870, 1871
- 14th amendment- equal protection - 1868
-in 1875 created general federal question jurisidction statute
[[28 U.S.C. §1331]] distrcit courts shall have og jurisdiction over LL CIVIL ACTIONS "ARISING UNDER"
- us constitution
- laws of the u.s. 
- treaties


#### SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL COURTS

###### A. THE IDEA AND THE STRUCTURE OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
Doctrine | Personal Jurisdiction | Federal Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
--------- | ---------------------- | -----------------------------------
Constitutional Source | Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment | Article III 
Statutory Source | State and federal long-arm statutes (e.g., Rule 4(k)(1)(A)) | Federal jurisdictional statutes (e.g., 28 U.S.C. §§1331, 1332, etc.) 
Effect | Limits power of state and federal courts in any given state over cases involving defendants without sufficient connections to that state | Limits power of federal courts to certain kinds of cases
-factors that affect a lawyers decision whether to bring a suit in state or federal court include:
- tactics & strategy
- differences in: case load, jury size & composition,  etc.

**exclusive jurisdiction- jurisdiction NOT shard w state courts:
- admiralty/maritime law
- antitrust
- bankruptcy
- copyright
- patent

declaratory relief- defendant files against plaintiff to be declared innocent 


Supreme court jurisdiction is broader than all lower federal courts
- not bound by the well-pleaded complaint rule
- SC need only find a federal question in the case
-lower federal courts are bound by [[28 U.S.C. §1331]]

federal jurisdiction question
well pleaded complaint rule- complaint on its face must raise a federal question

art III § 2
28 USC § 1331 - 

[[LOUISVILLE & NASHVILLE RAILROAD v. MOTTLEY (1908)]]

*can never waive federal jurisdiction question, cannot be agreed or consented upon by both parties

**Federalizing a case
- narrow exception to requiring federal question as p's cause of action
- test: does a state law claim
	- necessarily raise a federal issue
	- federal issue is actually disputed & substantial
	- a federal forum may entertain the issue without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities 


concurrent jurisdiction- when plaintiff has a choice between state and federal court

federal question jurisdiction- what does the plaintiff want & why are they suing



**Whether** the federal district court has subject matter jurisdiction over P's claim for breach of contract **when** P alleges that D will raise a defense under a federal statute

-rule - fed crts are of limited jurisidiction [[Article III]] section 2
well-pleaded complaint rule- cite [[28 U.S.C. §1331]]

Under facts of this case P's complaint alleges only breach  of contract action, it does not raise a federal issue as required by Art III sec 2 and 28 USC 1331. The well-pleaded complaint rule that requires that the federal question appear on the face of p's complaint has not been satisfied because th ep
s complaint in this case only raises a state issue. P's anticipation of D's likely defense under a federal statute would be insufficient to create a federal question under the well-pleaded complaint rule

therefore,
 grant motion to dismiss


### Diversity Jurisdiction

us con art III section 2 permits but does not mandate fed court jurisdiction in- controversies between diff states, between a state or citizens of, and foreign states, citizens or subjects

28 usc 1332 diversity jurisdiction



9/7/22

- 28 usc 1332- district court have og jurisdition over all civil action where amt in controvrsy exceeds $75k  and is between:
 1. citizens of different states
 2. citizens of a state & citizens or subjects of a foreign state;
 3. citizen of different state & in which citizns or subjects of a foreign states are additional parties &
 4. a foreign state, as plaintiff and citizens of a state or of different states

diversity jurisdiction origins & purpose-
- neutral forum (out of state bias)

[[Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)]]
- taney restricts us citizenship by race
denies citizenship, personhood & access to federal courts based on race
- scott does not have the right to sue as it is an entitlement reserved for citizens
- dissenting opinions- curtis & mclean disagree as they say diversity jurisdiction comes from citizenship of different states- scott had resided in a separate state 

const. claims:
- 4th amendment (unreasonable search & seizure
- 14th & 5th amendments (due process)
fed statutory claims:
- 42 usc 1981 (discrimination in contracting

access to justice
- civil justice, affects equality (housing, discrimination, accomodations)
- barries: money, lawyers as gatekeepers, rules of civil procedure, public perception: negative experiences & perceptions of crim justice system, negative experiences w public institutions, belief in self-help, lack of trust

[[Redner v. Sanders (2000)]]
individuals = citizenship in state = domicile
domicile = residence + intent to remain indefinitely
residence in state or foreign country alone not enough 
us citizenship alone not enough
* citizens admitted as LPR- citizen of state in which they are domiciled 

[[Hertz Corp. v. Friend (2010)]]
*removal*
plaintiff says nah we dont wanna be in fed court bc theyre claiming violation of STATE law (california)

corporations
- place of incorporation 
- principal place of business

PPB = nerve center
nerve center = headquarters
corporation can have only one PPB
*nerve center location controls diversity jurisdiction*

- diversity jurisdiction is concurrent, can be heard in state court
- diversity jurisdiction determined at the time complaint is filed
- complete diveristy rule under 1332- all plaintiffs citizens od a different state than all defendants (strawbridge v curtiss)
- party invoking court's SMJ (usually plaintiff) has burden of proof- preponderance of the evidence
- you challenge diversity jurisdiction through motion of dismiss for lack of SMJ, challenge cn be made at any time

-ask for the contract, which can limit where suit/arbitration may take place. 
-any other instances of microwaves blowing up (class action lawsuit?)


9/12
amount in controversy

The issue surfaced in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546 (2005). 

In Allapattah the Court had to decide whether to include within the supplemental jurisdiction granted by 28 U.S.C. §1367 (discussed infra at pages 232-35) claims held by parties who met the diversity requirement but for less than $75,000. 
- Yes, said the court, in part because the amount in controversy requirement was less central to the idea of diversity jurisdiction: 
- To ensure that diversity jurisdiction does not flood the federal courts with minor disputes, §1332(a) requires that the matter in controversy in a diversity case exceed a specified amount, currently $75,000. . . .  [W]e have consistently interpreted §1332 as requiring complete diversity: In a case with multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, the presence in the action of a single plaintiff from the same State as a single defendant deprives the district court of original diversity jurisdiction over the entire action.

#### Federal SMJ
 federal court & access to justice

1. fed question j
art III sec 2 28 usc 1331
arising under jurisdiction
well-pleaded complaint rule

2. diversity j
art III sec 2
28 usc 1332
- diveristy of citizenship: definition of citizenship: citizenship in a state REQUIRED, individuals, corporations (indiviual citizenship -> domicile -> residence *physical presence*, and intent to remain indefinitely) (citizenship of corporation- PPB hq, nerve center, CEO)
- complete diversity: diversity across the "v"
- amount in controversy requirement: "more than $75,000 at stake"

1332 (d)- CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT
class action- group of people together file a lawsuit

28 usc 1332 (c)(2) legal representative of the estte of a decedent, infant or incompetent- citizen of same state as decedent or infant/incompetent ([[Hawkins v. Masters Farm (2003)]])

28 usc 1332 (e) "state" includes:
- DC
- commonwealth of PR
- territories (guam, american samoa, us virgin islands)

*in determining diversity of citizenship- time of filing is operative time, with exception of CAFA*

partnerships, unincorporated associations (LLCs) & unions- a collection of individuals- look to the citizenship of each member
some courts allow limited discovery of citizenship facts!

federal courts will not hear divorce cases, even if parties are diverse (same with probate matters)

*where case is filed is not important for subject matter jurisdiction, is important for personal jurisdiction*

where accident occurs also irrelevant.


1. no, not complete diversity
2. yes
3. yes
4. yes
5. not diversity jurisdiction but fed q j 
6. p has to file before they move
7. yes class action suit over $5 million, only minimzl diversity needed. if AIC less than 5 mil, ALL named parties must be diverse 

#### Diversity in controversy
statutory amt- in excess of $75k
when determined?- at time action commenced. 
required level of proof?- sum claimed by P controls
if claims made in good faith
must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amt
burden on party asserting J to show that it is not a legal certainty that claim is for less

**injunctions**- court order asking the court to order defendant to stop doing something- what are the various approaches?
- value of the injunction to P (approach used by majority of jurisdictions)
- cost to D of complying
- cost or value to the party invoking federal jurisdiction
- allow jurisdiction if any of the tests yields a figure of the statutory amount 

aggregation- adding up value of claims

- 1p & 1d- aggregation- ok (add up value of all P's claims)

- P meets AIC & 2p (doesnt meet AIC) vs 1d- ok if ps claims related

- 1P vs multiple ds- must meet aic for each D (unless exception applies)
	exception:
	multiple Ps or Ds with common undivided interest & single title or right 
	(ex: joint ownership in land)

- A SINGLE P can aggregate claims both related and unrelated

class action
typicl class act- some named class members need to meet the amt in controversey (remainder can aggregate)
class action fairness act (over $5 mil)
yes class action suit over $5 million, only minimzl diversity needed. if AIC less than 5 mil, ALL named parties must be diverse 

counterclaim
- if p's claim exceeds jurisdictional amount:
- - compulsory counterclaim may be heard regardless of the amount
- compulsory- same transaction or occurrence
- permissive CC- requires an independent jurisdictional basis 

28 U.S.C. §1367
A statute allowing federal courts with original subject matter jurisdiction to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over other claims that constitute the same case or controversy unless an express exception applies to the exercise of jurisdiction over such other claims.

[[In re Ameriquest Mortgage Co. Mortgage Lending Practices Litigation (2007)]]

[[Szendrey-Ramos v. First Bancorp (2007)]]

diversity j needs d of citizenship, complete diversity & amt in controversy requirement
- jurisdictional amount determined at the time complaint filed, does not matter how much is recovered. costs may be imposed/denied under 1332 (b)
- defense does not oust jurisdiction or show bad faith in regards to calculated amount in controversy 
- LPR qualifies as citizenship 


#### Removal 
28 U.S.C. §1441


cit ny sues against ny corp, fed statute, damages of 50k
has federal q j
but what if we add a state claim?- related to same facts 
yeee suppelemental jurisdiction

#### Supplemental Jurisdiction
[[28 U.S.C. §1367]]
- subsection a creates supplemental jurisdiction
- subsec b limits the use of supplemental j in diversity cases


district courts have supp j over so related claims that they form part or of same case or controversy under article III 

why supp j?- try whole case at once, avoid duplicative litigation, promotes judicial economy & efficiency 
28


how to determine so related to fed claim they support same case?
- common nucleus  of operative fact
- ordinarily would expect to try claims tg
- overlap in facts, evidence, witnesses, timing

why isnt it unconstitutional for a fed district courl to hear the state law claims?
- same case or controversy (Art III)

at what point in litigation is determination on supp j made? 
- when complaint is filed, look at pleadings

federal SMJ must be present over at least one (1) claim 

[[In re Ameriquest Mortgage Co. Mortgage Lending Practices Litigation (2007)]]
- claims relaated, discretionary factors not present

[[Szendrey-Ramos v. First Bancorp (2007)]]
- claims related but court declines to exercie over 28 usc 1367 (c)
- discretionary factors: state claims (novel & complex issues regarding puerto rican law)


**discretionary factors**: 
- even when supp j exists court can use discretion to decline
	1. novel or complex issue of state law
	2. state claim substantially predominates
	3. fed court original jurisdiction claims dismissed
	4. exceptional circumstances


tolling provision in 1367 (d)
- provides 30 day window to re-file in state court- tries to assist plaintiffs avoid losing claims due to statutes of limitations

- A, a citizen of Illinois, sues B, also a citizen of Illinois, alleging that B violated federal civil rights statutes in firing her. A seeks to add a state law claim alleging that her firing also violated a state wrongful discharge law. Is there supplemental jurisdiction? 
**yes

- A, a citizen of Illinois, sues B, also a citizen of Illinois, alleging that B violated federal civil rights statutes in firing her. A seeks to add a state law claim alleging that B negligently caused her injuries when his car backed into hers in the company parking lot. Is there supplemental jurisdiction? 
**no

- A, a citizen of Illinois, sues B, also a citizen of Illinois, alleging that B violated federal civil rights statutes by permitting co-workers to engage in sexual harassment. A invokes Rule 20 to join C, a co-worker from Illinois, who actually engaged in the harassment. State tort law is the basis of A’s claim against C. Because C is not A’s employer, the claim against him does not arise under federal law. Is there supplemental jurisdiction over the claim against C? 
**you can bring a claim forward over an additional individual , supp j over pendent party is expressly granted by last sentence in 1367(a)

- A, a citizen of Illinois, sues B, a citizen of Wisconsin, alleging breach of an employment contract and seeking a recovery in excess of $75,000. A invokes Rule 20 to join C, a citizen of Illinois; A alleges that C conspired with B to breach the employment contract. Is there supplemental jurisdiction over the claim against C? 
**no, c is joined as addiyonal defendant under rule 20 in a diversity-only case. 1367(b) withdraws grant of supp j since addded party desroys diveristy 

- Arthur, a citizen of New York, sues Barbara, a citizen of Pennsylvania, in federal district court. He alleges several claims: federal antitrust violations, federal securities law violations, and state law breach of contract. He alleges more than $100,000 in damages for each claim. Will the district court have to analyze how closely related the federal and state law claims are for purposes of deciding whether supplemental jurisdiction exists or whether any of the reasons in §1367(c) for declining to exercise jurisdiction apply? Why not?
**no, div supplies independent ground of fed j for state law claims and supp j will thus be necessary 

Legal issue- would a fed d court have subject matter j over a plaintiffs claim that her employer breached her employment k that is raised in her complaint along w her claim for wrongful teerminatio brought under a fedral statute when th plaintiff and the dfedendant are citizens of the same state


rule- fed court must have fed subject mattr j over all claims
since cara's employment discrimination claim under a fed statute the court clearly has fed q j over that claim. 

og SMJ over claim a
claim b = breach of k = state law claim
no rising under j
no fed q over added claim b
p citizen of ny and d citizen of ny 
no diversity between claim b parties

supplmenetal? 
og f SMJ 
additional claim- related
from same case or controversy
do claims arise from a common nucleus of operative fact
ordinarily

#### Removal

gives defendants ability 
plaintiffs file initial comlaint where they would like to start
if p chooses state court, d in some circumstances can remove from state court and move to federal court by filing notice of removal

28 usc 1441- framework/basis for removal
- fed SMJ

1446, -
- only d can remove- based on claims brought against them
- file notice of removal in federal court- 30 day window
- d's must join or consent

1447
- procedure after removal (remand)

restrictions on removal in d juris

1447 (remand)- 
procedural defects
- file motion for remand
- 30 days after filing notice of removal
- 1447(c)

lack of SMJ
- remand anytime
- 1447(c)

remand order not reviewable on appeal 
1447(d)

***can only remand cases that began in state court and were removed to federal court


**would it be removable?**

1. P sues D for defamation in state court; D believes the statement she published is protected under the First Amendment.- 

2. P sues D in state court, alleging violation of P’s rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.- yes, complaint arises under constitution

 3. P, a citizen of Florida, sues D, a citizen of New Jersey, on a personal injury claim, in a Florida state court, seeking $100,000 in damages.- yes, div jurisdiction is met, amount in controversy is met

4. P, a citizen of Florida, sues D, a citizen of New Jersey, on a personal injury claim in New Jersey state court, seeking $100,000 in damages.- no, home state rule

5. The facts are the same as in Problem 1d, except that P adds a claim that D has violated her federal civil rights.- yes, 

6. P, a citizen of Florida, sues D, a citizen of New Jersey, and E, a citizen of New York, on a personal injury claim in New York state court, seeking $100,000 in damages.- no, one citizen is d of home state. 


---------------
1. Plaintiff, a citizen of Pennsylvania, files a complaint in Pennsylvania state court alleging state law violations, naming Danielle as defendant and seeking $100,000 in damages. Danielle is a citizen of Georgia. If Danielle wishes to remove, what must her notice of removal say?- 
- parties consent to removal
- parties are domiciled in different states
- danielle is not a citizen of state which court resides in, home state rule does not apply
2. If in her notice of removal Danielle falsely states that she is a citizen of Georgia, what risks does she run?
- sanctions being placed
3. Danielle files her notice of removal two months after being served with the state court complaint. Assuming that the conditions for diversity exist, can she remove?
- No, it must be 30 days after additional claim (motion to remand)
4. Same problem as in 2a, except that plaintiff’s initial complaint seeks only $10,000 in damages. Six months later, after some discovery, plaintiff amends his state complaint to add an additional cause of action, so he now seeks $85,000 in damages. May Danielle now remove?
- yes its removable, 30 days from amended complaint. amt of controversy has now been met
6. Same problem as in 2a. Defendant removes, invoking diversity. What if plaintiff seeks remand to state court, offering to stipulate that she would seek less than $75,000 in damages? The Sixth Circuit, in Rogers v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 230 F.3d 868 (6th Cir. 2000), affirmed a denial of the remand motion, saying that the propriety of removal should be judged by the apparent amount in controversy at the time removal is sought.
- 
8. Plaintiff’s complaint seeks $10,000 in damages. Danielle seeks to remove, claiming that if she is liable, which she denies, the damages are far more than the jurisdictional amount alleged. May she remove? What does §1446(c) say about this problem?
-  court may find there is more at stake than what the plaintiff claims, removable
10. Same problem as in 2d, except that plaintiff amends his complaint more than a year after the original complaint. What obstacle to removal does §1446(c) pose?
- no outside 1 year expiration date
11. As in 2g, the complaint when first filed alleges less than the amount in controversy and the notice of removal is made over a year after the complaint is filed. Suppose defendant contends that the plaintiff knew from the start that the claim—if it was worth anything, which defendant denies—was worth at least $100,000. Can defendant remove? See §1446(c)(3)(B).
- if they can prove p was filed in bad faith, 1 yr expiration can be waived
12. Suppose a complaint filed in state court alleges federal employment discrimination and additional state law claims. If the state law claims are so closely related to the federal claim that they fall within supplemental jurisdiction, the entire case may be removed. But suppose they are not—they are contract claims too unconnected with the discrimination count to be part of the “same case or controversy.” Read §1441(c) and explain what will happen to the state and federal claims.
- remand state claims back 


Eleanor Washington, a citizen of Illinois, wants to sue David Jones, a citizen of Michigan, for injuries arising from a car accident that occurred when Eleanor was visiting a friend in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Eleanor alleges $75,000 in damages due to medical expenses and $25,000 in damages due to damage to her car.  **Must** Eleanor’s lawyer file her complaint in federal court?
- No, diversity jurisdiction is concurrent and not exclusive.

On June 1, Kate Tent, a citizen of Alameda, California sues Spencer Peck, a citizen of Trenton, New Jersey and Craig Brown, a citizen of Albany, New York in state court in New York.  Kate alleges that either Spencer or Craig or both of them caused an accident in New York in which Kate was injured and claims $100,000 in damages. Ten days after receiving the complaint, the filed a notice of removal action in federal court.  If Kate files a motion for remand, is she likely to be successful?
- Yes, because Craig is a citizen of New York.

On January 1, Ernest Gaines, a citizen of Iowa, filed and served a claim against his former supervisor Jacob Fain, a citizen of Nebraska, and his employer, Dan & Harry’s, Inc. alleging a violation a federal statute barring discrimination in employment on the basis of age.  Ernest is seeking $50,000 in damages for lost wages.  On January 25, Dan & Harry’s, a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in Iowa, filed a Notice of Removal in federal district court in Iowa.  On Feb. 1, Ernest filed a motion for remand.  How is the court likely to rule?
- The federal district court is likely to deny the motion for remand since the case raises a federal question.

On June 1, 2021, Cody Liu, a citizen of Connecticut sued Shannon Bales, a citizen of Rhode Island and Tiffany Bell, a citizen of Connecticut, in state court in Connecticut.  Cody alleges that Shannon or Tiffany or both of them caused a three-car accident on I-95 in Connecticut in which Cody was injured and suffered $250,000 in damages.  On June 10, 2022, Cody and Tiffany reach a settlement agreement and Tiffany is dismissed from the action.  One June 20, 2022, Shannon’s lawyer filed a notice of removal to federal court alleging the grounds for removal as diversity jurisdiction since Cody and Shannon are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.  Is removal proper?
- Yes, because the diversity jurisdiction requirements have been met in the action at the time the notice was filed.

SMJ IN SUMMARY
state crt = gen jurisdiction
power ot hear all kinds of civ actions unless exclusive to fed crt

fed crt is limited juris
- any judgement entered by a court that lacked SMJ- void
- consitution must grant power to fed court- art III sec 2
- congress must grant power to ower fed crt
- 1331- fed q j
- 1332- diveristy j
- 1367- supp j
	- OG FED SMJ ovwer one claim + related claim
	- common nucleus of operative fact
	- restrictions in diveristy j cases on supp j over p's claims against other parties
- removal
	- d's power to remove cate to fed crt if fed SMJ suffices in claims brought agaisnt D
	- if d meets staturoy requirements and follows proper procedure
	- remember limitations in diversity actions
	- home state d rule & one year outside limit on removal from commencement of the action 

## Personal jurisdiction power & fairness
- every civil action threatens parties with the posssibility of a taking their liberty or property
- lawsuits & the power of a court to do so raise concerns about due process
- us consituttion- 5th & 14th amendments
- - 5th amendment- applies to federal govt
- 14th amendment- applies to states

subject matter jurisdiciton- what is the case about, does it belong in fed crt?
personal jurisdiction- who is being sued, where should it be filed? 

personal jurisdiction vs subject matter jurisdiction
- pj focuses on relationship between defendant and forum state
- power of a state or fed crt to compel a defendant to appear
- judgement entered without PJ is void 
PJ- WHERE a defendant can be sued


- defendants relationship w FORUM state (where it was filed)
nature of the claim (why the defendant was sued)
- relevant time period: BEFORE the suit was filed

Pennoyer v. Neff
eek

physical presence of a person or property in a state can crete PJ
RE: Property
- attach property when the lawsuit commenced
RE: INDIVIDUALS
- personally serve defendant who is physically present in forum state
federalism:
- each state is soveregn and ndependent withi n its territorial boujndaries
- power of each state is limited by the power of other states and the fed govt
- states are limited in their ability to affect people & property outside its bounds
full faith and credit
- judgements entered into wihtout PJ oer D are invalid and need not to be given full faith & credit
- judgements withoutPJare invalid
- court need not enforce a judgement where PJ lacking

collateral attack- in personam


individual liberty interests 


### personal jurisdiction
pj over defendant- constitutionally required
pennoyer- physicl presence or property in state = PJ
**d- 14th & 5th amend. due process
federalism
- each state sovereign & independent- in its boundaries
- states limited in ability to affect people & property outside its boundaries

pennpyer v neff supreme cort
full faith & credit
- judgements intered into w/o pj over d are invalid and need not to be given full faith & credit (article 4 sec 1)
- judgements without pj are invalid
- courts need not enforce a judgemen where pj is lacking
- no full faith and credit
- judgment without pj subject to collateral attack

full faith & credit shall be given each state to public acts, records & judicial proceedings of every otgher state
public acts -= laws
records = govt issued docs
judicial proceedings = court judgments

pennoyer- notice= all d's entitled to notice of the lawsuit
- constructive notice- notice by publication

when can a state decide issues involving non-citizens
civil status- divorce
contracts entered into in the state (subject matter & form
corporations formed in state)
property in state
consent

according to pennoyer- does a state court have PJ over its own citizens, even if outside state?
- yes d's home state has PJ over D
- d's domicile
- true, fixed & permanent 


personal jurisdiction

- in personam- PJ over the person in the forum state
- in rem- PJ over the property in forum state 
- quasi in rem- D has property in forum, and property used to satisfy a judgement against D

pj is consitutionally required
14th & 5th due process 
no pj = not enforceable = can be attacked 


International Shoe Co. v. Washington

presence is a diction- it just symbolizes the actions of a corporation
- look to contacts or activities in the forum state (employees, contracts,website, manufacturing, soliciting)
- "due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgement in personam if he be not present within the territory of the forum, that he have certain minumum ccontacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice

sliding scale of minimum contacts
examine quality & nature of d's contacts
- no PJ: isolated/casual events, no contacts
- specific PJ: single-act, continuous, systematic contacts (contacts MUST be related to claim/ as to why you are being sued)
- general PJ: substantial, pervasive contacts 

under what circumstances will a defendant ALWAYS be subject to general jurisdiction?
- under what circumstances will a defendant always be subject to general jurisdiction?
- corporations?
	- place of incorporation &
	-  principal place of business
		- nerve center (HQ)
- Individuals?
	- domicile
		- presence + intent to remain indefinitely

- - needs minimum contacts such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play & substantial justice

minimum contact + fair play & substantial justice = PJ

d are subject to PJ where they are a citizen 
corps= place of incorp & pricnipal place of business
idnviduals = domicile
(physical presence + inttent to remain indefinitely
AND where they have sufficient minimum contacts & pj would be reasonable )


[[McGee v. International Life Insurance Co.]]

[[Hanson v. Denckla]]

[[World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson]]

- products are created meant to be MOBILE, so it must be forseeable that harm may occur outside of the principal place of business
- supreme court reverses because of due process clause within the 14th amendment
- minimum contact w state required
- d must act- purpose availment required!- 
- reasonable anticipation
- forseeability is not enough


focus on defendants actions, reasonable anticipation
- personal availment of the benefits & protections of the state
- targeting the market in the state
- efforts to serve the market in the state
- (eg sales, profits, employees, advertisements, etc.)
- contacts- RELATED TO CLAIM!
- creates predictability 

The relationship between the defendant and the forum must be such that it is “reasonable  . . . to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there.” Implicit in this emphasis on reasonableness is the understanding that the burden on the defendant, while always a primary concern, will in an appropriate case be considered in light of other relevant factors, including the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute; the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, at least when that interest is not adequately protected by the plaintiff’s power to choose the forum, cf. Shaffer v. Heitner; the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and p. 102the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.

1. burden on (convenience) D
2. forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute 
	- providing a forum for citizens to sue
	- providing a forum for non resident injured ps
	- preventing corporations from coming to state committing torts without being subject to jurisdiction
3. P's interest in Convenient and effective relief
	- ability to pursue small claims in  a convenient forum
	- suing at home
4. interstate judicial systems interest in efficient resolution of controversies
	- location of evidence, witnesses, jurisdiction all over the parties, choice of law, or apply unfamiliar law
5. shared interest of the several states in furthering fundametal substantial social pollicies
	- non US d's
	- complicated non-US law

**minimum contacts required for nonresident Ds
- purposeful availment- targeting market, effort to serve market, reasonable anticipation

minimum contacts such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play & substantial justice

minimum contacts + reeasonablness factors = PJ

- contacts continuum- nature & quality of contacts
- more casual or isolated? single act?
- continuous & systematic
- purposeful availment
- reasonable anticipation
- specific jurisdiction- relatedness
- burden on D
- forum states interest in adjudicating the dispute
- p's interest in convenient & effective relief
- interstate judicial systems' interest in efficient resolution of controversies
- shared interest of the several states in fundamental substantial social policies

[[J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro]]

kennedy plurality (no majority)
- general jurisdiction- no consent, not a citizen. no!
- specific jurisdcition
	- dp protects individual liberty right to be deprive of life liberty property only lawfully
	- contacts? relatedness?- no purposeful availment, no intent to benefit from protection of state laws, no intent to serve NJ market


[[Abdouch v. Lopez]]
calder effects test:
tort:
- intentional
- outside forum state
- aimed at forum state 
- caused harm in state
- d knew harm would be caused in state

they find there in no PJ in Nebraska

[[Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown]]
sliding scale for internet contact

ACTIVE:
internet contact- interconnectivity
active, engages website doing business, can be personal jurisdiction (ex entering contract)

-----------
Whether or not the Illinois state court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant Oregon Automobile Insurance when they sold the policy to plaintiff in Illinois. 

Rule: 
The exercise of personal jurisdiction in state court must be consistent with the due process clause of the 14th amendment 

In order for jurisdiction to be constitutional, for non residential defendants, there must be certain min contacts such that the maintenace of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play & substantial justice. 

PJ based on contacts must illustrate:
- quality & nature of d's contacts
- more than casual or isolated and constitute a single act or be consistent and systematic
- purposefully avail or benefits & protections of forum state
- d reasonably anticipates being sued in forum
- claim must be related to arise out of contacts

reasonableness factors:
- specific jurisdiction- relatedness
- burden on D
- forum states interest in adjudicating the dispute
- p's interest in convenient & effective relief
- interstate judicial systems interest in efficient resolution of controveries
- shared interest of the several states in fundamental substantial social policies

Analysis: 
The president, in traveling to illinois, clearly intent to market & advertise, conduct business in illinois. 

C- the court will likely find that d has engaged in  rule in favor of the plaintiff as there is minimum contact sufficient for personal jurisdiction



[[Daimler AG v. Bauman]] 

affiliation w the state are not so continuous and systematic to render it "essentially at home" in forum state
- insufficient contact in cali
- pj inconsistent w contact 

citizen = access to state court

what court?
fed crt- fed q (p's claim is under federal statute) or diversity j

state crt- 

Personal jurisdiction

D.P.- citizen-delaware
-maine
-ny

D- activities, conduct, minimum contacts

general jurisdiction (anything goes)
specific jurisdiction (limited jurisidiction, must be related to contacts)

subject matter jurisdiction -does the claim belong in federal court? (what court?)

personal jurisdiction- where is the D being sued & where should the case be filed? (what state?)

certain minimum contacts such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend fair play & substantial justice

specific- purposeful availment, reasonable anticipation, and related contacts
general- substantial & pervasive contacts "essentially at home"

#### general jurisdiction
pj over d for all claims related & unrelated

state of citizenshipp
- corporations = place of incorporations
- individuals -domicile

based on contacts
- contacts with the state are so 'continuous and systematic' as the render them essentially at home in the forum state

SC in goodyear & daimler limited use of gen jurisdiction to (1) place of d's citizenship or (2) where d has so many contacts in the forum they are essentially at home
after goodyear & daimler most PJ cases will need to satisfy Spec juris requirements.

what does it mean for a contact to be related to a claim?

PJ
does a state statute authorize PJ? (long arm)
if yes, is PJ constitutional?
-d- home?
-d- contacts?
-fair

[[Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court]]


D- 
-did not produce Plavix in California
-plaintiffs outside of california: medication was not bought, taken or prescribed in california
-plavix regulatory approval work not done in CA

P-
-BMS has substantial activities in california: lab facilities, research, sales reps, govt advocacy office, profit from plavix in state, many pills of plavix sold in state 

PJ- limited by due process clause
-limitation on state power

general jursidction
- requires extensive contacts
specific PJ
-min contacts w forum state
focus on d's contacts
-purposeful  availment
reasonable antiticpation
-relatedness
substantion justice & fair 

because BMS turned it to focus on ONLY plavix, the relatedness has turned.


ford v montana 8
plaintiffs argumment:
-PJ
ford engages in signifciant business in forum
ford advertises & promotes its products in forum (billboard, tv ads)
dealerships
ford dealers provide maintenaance & repair to ford cars
accident occured in ofrum
pjs citizens of forum
ps were injured in forum
relationship between fords activities in forum  & claims

defendants-
no PJ
concedes substantial activities (purposeful availment)
BUT
fords activities in the state didnt cause Ps injuries

Supreme Crt:
-14th protects due process & interstate federalism- limits a states power to exercise jurisdiction over a D

(due process in fed crt is 5th amendment)

general jurisdiction
(extends to any & all claims)
indivudal-domicile
corporations- place of inc. & PPB

contacts- D must be "essentially at home" in forum state

Specific jurisdiction

contacts
purposeful availment of the benefits & protections of the forum state- "deliberately reaching out"
reasonable anticipation- fair warning so as to "structure primary conduct"

selling cars, advertising & promoting products, retail outlets, providing parts & services, creating a market in the state; entering into contracts

contacts must arise out of or relate to claim
A contact can relate to claim even without a causal relationship

Ps harmed in forum by the same type of vehicle market

-finds that "there is a strong relationship among the D the forum & the litigation"
-fair & just to find PJ over D in forum
-states have significant interests at stake
protecting citizens
providing forum for injured citizens
enforcing safety regulations

personal jurisdiction
consistent w DP clause

traditional bases of PJ- citizenship, domicile, PPB & place of incorporation

minimum contacts
SPecific jurisdiction:
min contacts exhibited 
purposeful availment, reasonable anticipation & relatedness
general jurisdiction:
continuous, systematic & substantial contacts
D essentially at home

nonresident D's & reasonable? PJ fair?


## Personal Jurisdiction: Power & COnsent

supreme court:
forum selection clause- enforceable
consent to PJ through contract

FSC-

general enforced by courts UNLESS:
-  contract invalid
- party would be deprived of its right to sue because of inconvenience or unfainress
- P would be denied remedy
- strong public policy against enforcement
- issues outside the scope of agreement
- lack of notice might also make a difference 
- FSC was not reasonably communicated- court may not enforce. 

CONSENT TO PJ
express-
consent to contract prior to litigation
agree or consent to PJ when sued
appointed agent in state to accept service of process in state

implied-
-state stautes require non residents to act in the state to appoint a state official to accept service of prcoess in the state on their behalf
eg non resident drivers that cause accidnet in state
waive objections to PJ through not protecting them properly


### TAG JURISDICTION
voluntarily physically present- can be served if present in that state

- cannot use force or fraud
- many states parred pj over ds in state bc of a subpoena to take part in judicial proceedings
- defendant within airspace of a state is still physically prsent in state for PJ purposes (GRACE V MACARTHUR 1959)

*what if you had a forced/emergency landing*

LIMITS to the application of "tag" or transient jurisdiction
- involuntarily in state (eg kidnapped
- fraud 

courts need: PJ over d's
- required by due process clause

traditional bases
citizenship, domicile, PPB & PI Inc.
consent or waiver
tag j, personal service in state

OR if u have no base and u have a non-resident D

then u apply minimum contacts & all that 

minimum contacts such that the maintenance of thhe suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play & substantial justice
specific J
quality & nature
(more than casual or isolated contacts)
relatedness
purposeful availment
reasonable anticipation  (generally essentially at home)


AND

reasonableness factors
-burden on d

## personal jurisdiction & long arm 

long arm statute- a statute that a state can enact that sets the boundaries of who can use their courts. legislature of each state grants power to courts in the state to exercise PJ through jurisdictional statutes

Gibbons v Brown
in order to address PJ question, you must first determine whether the suit authorized by state long arm statute

PJ was not authorized by the state long arm statute
-gibbons was not engaged in substantial activity in florida
1st suit cannot forever subect Gibbons to the statute

LONG ARM STATUTES CANNOT GIVE COURTS MORE AUTHORITY THAN UNDER COSNITUTION
state statutes that limit where an action may be brought
for ds not found in state:
1. first ask whether jurisdiction complies w the long arm statute of the state in which the court is sitting
2. if no- no personal jurisdiction
3. if yes, look to whether jurisdiction is constitutional
-  traditional bases?
- citizenship 
- tag J
- consent or waiver
- min contacts, relatedness, pj reasonable
- substantial contacts & essentialy at home

federal courts:
-usually follow long arm statute of state in which they are located
in most instances federal courts have no more jurisdictional reach than state courts
exceptions:
- federal securities laws
- federal interpleader act

Broad long arm statutes
- exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent w the constiution of the state or the united states (ex california)

Enumerated long arm statutes
- jurisdiction llimited to specified instances
- typically narrower than the constiution or to the extent of the constitution

Uniform interstate & international procedure Act 13 ULA 355
- 20 states follow this model

pJ over ds
does long arm authorize PJ
if no- no PJ
if yes- is pj constitutional (due process)

contracts- must be forum selection clause to EXCLUDE all other forums

forum selection clause- chooses forum to the exclusion of all others
consent to jurisdiction- consent to not object to jurisdiction in a forum
choice of law- what law applies

### COMPLAINTS
- complaint must include allegations of SMJ & PJ
- complaint & summons are served on defendant
- defendant then must decide how to respond
- responses:
	- default (nada)
	- answer (respond to allegations- admit, deny, etc.)
	- file motion (ask court to do something)

RULE 12(B)
motions to dismiss
1. lack of smj
2. lack of pj
3. improper venue
4. insufficient process (defective summons)
5. insufficient service of process
6. failure to state a claim
7. failure to join a party under R19

Rule 12(g)- consolidation
Rule 12(h)- waiver
- a party may join motions together 
- MUST raise motions to dismiss for:
	- (b)(2) lack of pj
	- (b)(3) improper venue
	- (b)(4) insufficient process (defective summons)
	- (b)(5) insufficient service of process
IF U DONT THESE OBJECTIONS WILL BE WAIVED!!!

objections NOT waived
rule 12(b)(6) failure to state a claim &
12(b)(7) failure to join a party
- can be brought later as a 
	- in any pleading
	- rule 12(c); or
	- at trial

rule12(b)(1) SMJ
- cannot be waived by parties or the court
- can be raised at ANY time

rule12(a)- time to respond- 21 days from service

Rule 11- u must do legal research before filing

## Notice
need SMJ, PJ, and Notice

mullane v central hanover bank
due process clause requires defendant to receive proper notice of a lawsuit filed against them 

notice reasonably calculated to apprise D of pendency of the suit & opportunity to respond
notice a relative &  not an absolute value

actual notice- insufficient
- must follow rules of service
- see FRCP rule 4
-
notice by publication- suspect
-placed into consitutional shadow
process which is a mere gesture is not due process

Constitutional Notice
mullane v central hanover bank
- notice reasonably calculated to apprise D of the pendency of the suit & opportunity to respond. 
format used to notify still has to be constitutional 

notice by newspaper/publication is suspect

certified mail- TYPICALLY court believes mail service to be reliable. If mail gets returned (it was not delivered), plaintiff now needs to do more to reach person. (even if person was in jail & it was sent to the prisoners home!)

Notice
- must be constitutional
AND
- follow procedural rules of service
- FRCP Rule 4 governs rules of service of the complaint in federal courts
- after the complaint is properly served Rule 5 governs the service of other documents. 

Rule 4(a)(1)
- a summons is a paper issued by a court. it informs the person that a suit has been filed against them. it is the official document that requires the opposing party to respond to the complaint
- a summons MUST:
	- name the court & parties
	- state plaintiff or their attorneys name & address
	- notify defendant
		- time to respond
		- failure to respond leads to default for the relief in complaint
		- signed by clerk & have courts seal
- summons directs D to respond or appear in court on penalty of default judgement

defendant should file motion to dismiss- 12b4- defective summons- summons must name court

12b5- defective service of process- plaintiff himself served rather than a third party-- rule 4c- 

D has 90 days from filing to cite defective service- rule 4M

what factors help determine the relevant form of service?
- whats forms of service are permitted for individuals in US (r4(e)(1),(2))
- following state law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is loacted or where service is made; or 
- personal service
- leaving copy at individuals dwelling or suual place of abode with someone of suitable age & discretion who resides there or
- delivery of copy to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process
what forms of service are permitted for corporations, partnerships or associations?
- rule 4H
- follow rule 4h(1) for serving individuals
- deliver copy to officer, manager or general agent
- deliver copy to agent authorized to receive service of process... also by mailing a copy of each to the defendant . 

these rules pertain to competent adults (18+)

waiver of service
- a request to waive formal service and accept copy of complaint by mail
- what must p do if it choooses to use this procedure

4(2)(a)(b)
additional expenses

waiving formal service waives only objections to service

rule 4(K) provides
(1) federal courts have PJ
	(a) over a D who is subject to the PJ of a state court in the state
	pj same for federal & state court in same state
	(b) a party is joined under R14 or 19 and is served within 100 mi of court where summons is issused;
	(c) when authorized by federal statute
		- some federal statutues provide for nationwide jurisdiction (eg- federal securities & antitrust laws)
(2) federal claims
- PJ over D if D not subject PJ in state court; and
- PJ would be constitutional 
	- grants pj over D who have M.C. with US as a whole if constitutional

cheapest form of service- request a waiver by mail
must respond at least 30 days from when request was sent. 

defense to case is not an excuse for not returning waiver of service form

### SOOO

subject matter jurisdiciton (art 3, sec 2)- what court?
- 28 usc 1331, 1332, 1367

PJ- what state?
long arm authorized pj
pj constittutional?

notice
 - const notice (mullane)
 - service of process- R4
 - by whom? r4c
 - who? r4(e)-(i)
 - waiver of service- r4(d)
 - time for service r4(m)
## venue!

- in the state (1391)
- PJ locates the state in which jurisdiction is appropriate- where?what state?
- venue decides where in the state the suit should be brought
- judicial district or county
- states vary in the number of judicial district
- venue
	- statutory
		- federal statute: 28 usc 1391
		- applies to actions filed in us district court
	- special venue statutes
	- eg patent & copyright, shareholder derivative suits, suits against US
- relationship between location of suit, claims or parties

#### 1391
(a) shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in district courts of the US
(b) civil action may be brought in 
	(1)a JD in which any D resides, if all Ds are residents of the state in which the district is located 
	(2) a JD in which  a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.. or
	(3) if there is no JD, in an action may otherwise be brought, any JD in which any D is subject to PJ

** 1391 doesnt apply to cases removed to federal court

(c) defines residency
	(1) individuals & LPR = domicile
	(2) entity (inc or uninc.) = PJ
	(3) alien = any JD 

(d) residency of corps in multiple districts
- any JD in state where subject to PJ if JD were a separate state 


- aliens may be sued ANYWHERE 
- can parties agree/consent to a particular venue? yes

The Rules of Decision Act  
Rules of Decision Act (“RDA”) (a federal statute)  
states:  
- The laws of several states, except where the  
Constitution or Acts of Congress otherwise  
require or provide, shall be regarded as rules  
of decisions in civil actions in the courts of  
the United States, in cases where they apply.  
See 28 U.S.C. §1652 of 1789  
- In other words, federal courts should apply

Constitution or federal statutes apply  
- But . . . What constitutes “the laws of

The Erie Question  
When a federal court is deciding a case,

Federal Law-Constitution, Federal  
Statutes, Treaties  
Diversity case . . . . ?  
State law issues

RDA Only applies to state statutes & to state law on  
matters of peculiarly “local usages” (land title).  
 In other words, . . .  
 Swift found that federal courts need not apply state  
judge made law  
 “Court decisions are not laws they are at most evidence of  
what the laws are; and are not themselves laws.”  
 Instead, federal courts sitting in diversity were free to draw  
upon general legal principles ("general law")

Fed. common law from general principles of  
“right & reason  
 Need for a strong federal judiciary.  
 Desire to create uniformity in the laws  
 Federal courts expected to be a model for state courts

RDA intends that:Except where federal law applies . . .  
Federal courts with diversity jurisdiction should apply state law (statutes and case law)!
