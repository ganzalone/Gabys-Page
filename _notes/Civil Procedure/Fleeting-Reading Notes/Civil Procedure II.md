Judicial jurisdiction --personal jurisdiction (due process)
      |
      subject matter jurisdiction (article III)

- full faith & credit clause (IV) # states supporting states
- supremacy clause (VI)

- why file in federal court?- typically faster process, different civil procedures
- sources of law: 
	- constitution- articles & amendments
	- federal statutes- united states code (USC) *passed by legislative branch*
	- fed rules of civil procedure- (FRCP) -since 1938 have governed civil proceedings in US district courts. renewed & approved by supreme court & congress
	- case law- supreme court & lower fed court cases 

title 28- judiciary & judicial procedure code

what court? - subject matter jurisdiction
what state? - personal jurisdiction (fair & due process)

state courts- general jurisdiction
fed court- exclusive jurisdiction
fed & state court- shared jurisdiction

what is a motion?- document filed with court asking them to take action!

CITIZENSHIP OF INDIVIDUALS = **DOMICILE**
a) a person always **has one- and only one-** domicile;
b) an infant acquires a domicile at birth, which is almost always the domicile of her parents;
c) in order to **change her domicile**, a person must both
- **establish residence** in a new state and
- have the **intent to remain** in that state

the **residence and the intent to remain must exist at the same time**, even if only temporarily. (no floating intentions)

#### Federal Jurisdiction
-created after Civil War to protect newly created federal civil rights:
- civil rights acts of 1866, 1868, 1870, 1871
- 14th amendment- equal protection - 1868
-in 1875 created general federal question jurisidction statute
[[28 U.S.C. §1331]] distrcit courts shall have og jurisdiction over LL CIVIL ACTIONS "ARISING UNDER"
- us constitution
- laws of the u.s. 
- treaties


#### SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL COURTS

###### A. THE IDEA AND THE STRUCTURE OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
Doctrine | Personal Jurisdiction | Federal Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
--------- | ---------------------- | -----------------------------------
Constitutional Source | Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment | Article III 
Statutory Source | State and federal long-arm statutes (e.g., Rule 4(k)(1)(A)) | Federal jurisdictional statutes (e.g., 28 U.S.C. §§1331, 1332, etc.) 
Effect | Limits power of state and federal courts in any given state over cases involving defendants without sufficient connections to that state | Limits power of federal courts to certain kinds of cases
-factors that affect a lawyers decision whether to bring a suit in state or federal court include:
- tactics & strategy
- differences in: case load, jury size & composition,  etc.

**exclusive jurisdiction- jurisdiction NOT shard w state courts:
- admiralty/maritime law
- antitrust
- bankruptcy
- copyright
- patent

declaratory relief- defendant files against plaintiff to be declared innocent 


Supreme court jurisdiction is broader than all lower federal courts
- not bound by the well-pleaded complaint rule
- SC need only find a federal question in the case
-lower federal courts are bound by [[28 U.S.C. §1331]]

federal jurisdiction question
well pleaded complaint rule- complaint on its face must raise a federal question

art III § 2
28 USC § 1331 - 

[[LOUISVILLE & NASHVILLE RAILROAD v. MOTTLEY (1908)]]

*can never waive federal jurisdiction question, cannot be agreed or consented upon by both parties

**Federalizing a case
- narrow exception to requiring federal question as p's cause of action
- test: does a state law claim
	- necessarily raise a federal issue
	- federal issue is actually disputed & substantial
	- a federal forum may entertain the issue without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities 


concurrent jurisdiction- when plaintiff has a choice between state and federal court

federal question jurisdiction- what does the plaintiff want & why are they suing



**Whether** the federal district court has subject matter jurisdiction over P's claim for breach of contract **when** P alleges that D will raise a defense under a federal statute

-rule - fed crts are of limited jurisidiction [[Article III]] section 2
well-pleaded complaint rule- cite [[28 U.S.C. §1331]]

Under facts of this case P's complaint alleges only breach  of contract action, it does not raise a federal issue as required by Art III sec 2 and 28 USC 1331. The well-pleaded complaint rule that requires that the federal question appear on the face of p's complaint has not been satisfied because th ep
s complaint in this case only raises a state issue. P's anticipation of D's likely defense under a federal statute would be insufficient to create a federal question under the well-pleaded complaint rule

therefore,
 grant motion to dismiss


### Diversity Jurisdiction

us con art III section 2 permits but does not mandate fed court jurisdiction in- controversies between diff states, between a state or citizens of, and foreign states, citizens or subjects

28 usc 1332 diversity jurisdiction



9/7/22

- 28 usc 1332- district court have og jurisdition over all civil action where amt in controvrsy exceeds $75k  and is between:
 1. citizens of different states
 2. citizens of a state & citizens or subjects of a foreign state;
 3. citizen of different state & in which citizns or subjects of a foreign states are additional parties &
 4. a foreign state, as plaintiff and citizens of a state or of different states

diversity jurisdiction origins & purpose-
- neutral forum (out of state bias)

[[Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)]]
- taney restricts us citizenship by race
denies citizenship, personhood & access to federal courts based on race
- scott does not have the right to sue as it is an entitlement reserved for citizens
- dissenting opinions- curtis & mclean disagree as they say diversity jurisdiction comes from citizenship of different states- scott had resided in a separate state 

const. claims:
- 4th amendment (unreasonable search & seizure
- 14th & 5th amendments (due process)
fed statutory claims:
- 42 usc 1981 (discrimination in contracting

access to justice
- civil justice, affects equality (housing, discrimination, accomodations)
- barries: money, lawyers as gatekeepers, rules of civil procedure, public perception: negative experiences & perceptions of crim justice system, negative experiences w public institutions, belief in self-help, lack of trust

[[Redner v. Sanders (2000)]]
individuals = citizenship in state = domicile
domicile = residence + intent to remain indefinitely
residence in state or foreign country alone not enough 
us citizenship alone not enough
* citizens admitted as LPR- citizen of state in which they are domiciled 

[[Hertz Corp. v. Friend (2010)]]
*removal*
plaintiff says nah we dont wanna be in fed court bc theyre claiming violation of STATE law (california)

corporations
- place of incorporation 
- principal place of business

PPB = nerve center
nerve center = headquarters
corporation can have only one PPB
*nerve center location controls diversity jurisdiction*

- diversity jurisdiction is concurrent, can be heard in state court
- diversity jurisdiction determined at the time complaint is filed
- complete diveristy rule under 1332- all plaintiffs citizens od a different state than all defendants (strawbridge v curtiss)
- party invoking court's SMJ (usually plaintiff) has burden of proof- preponderance of the evidence
- you challenge diversity jurisdiction through motion of dismiss for lack of SMJ, challenge cn be made at any time


9/12
amount in controversy

The issue surfaced in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546 (2005). 

In Allapattah the Court had to decide whether to include within the supplemental jurisdiction granted by 28 U.S.C. §1367 (discussed infra at pages 232-35) claims held by parties who met the diversity requirement but for less than $75,000. 
- Yes, said the court, in part because the amount in controversy requirement was less central to the idea of diversity jurisdiction: 
- To ensure that diversity jurisdiction does not flood the federal courts with minor disputes, §1332(a) requires that the matter in controversy in a diversity case exceed a specified amount, currently $75,000. . . .  [W]e have consistently interpreted §1332 as requiring complete diversity: In a case with multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, the presence in the action of a single plaintiff from the same State as a single defendant deprives the district court of original diversity jurisdiction over the entire action.

#### Federal SMJ
 federal court & access to justice

1. fed question j
art III sec 2 28 usc 1331
arising under jurisdiction
well-pleaded complaint rule

2. diversity j
art III sec 2
28 usc 1332
- diveristy of citizenship: definition of citizenship: citizenship in a state REQUIRED, individuals, corporations (indiviual citizenship -> domicile -> residence *physical presence*, and intent to remain indefinitely) (citizenship of corporation- PPB hq, nerve center, CEO)
- complete diversity: diversity across the "v"
- amount in controversy requirement: "more than $75,000 at stake"

1332 (d)- CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT
class action- group of people together file a lawsuit

28 usc 1332 (c)(2) legal representative of the estte of a decedent, infant or incompetent- citizen of same state as decedent or infant/incompetent ([[Hawkins v. Masters Farm (2003)]])

28 usc 1332 (e) "state" includes:
- DC
- commonwealth of PR
- territories (guam, american samoa, us virgin islands)

*in determining diversity of citizenship- time of filing is operative time, with exception of CAFA*

partnerships, unincorporates associations (LLCs) & unions- collection of individuals- look to citizenship of each member
some courts allow limited discovery of citizenship facts!

federal courts will not hear divorce cases, even if parties are diverse (same with probate matters)

*where case is filed is not important for subject matter jurisdiction, is important for personal jurisdiction*

where accident occurs also irrelevant.


1. no, not complete diversity
2. yes
3. yes
4. yes
5. not diversity jurisdiction but fed q j 
6. p has to file before they move
7. yes class action suit over $5 million, only minimzl diversity needed. if AIC less than 5 mil, ALL named parties must be diverse 

#### Diversity in controversy
statutory amt- in excess of $75k
when determined?- at time action commenced. 
required level of proof?- sum claimed by P controls
if claims made in good faith
must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amt
burden on party asserting J to show that it is not a legal certainty that claim is for less

**injunctions**- court order asking the court to order defendant to stop doing something- what are the various approaches?
- value of the injunction to P (approach used by majority of jurisdictions)
- cost to D of complying
- cost or value to the party invoking federal jurisdiction
- allow jurisdiction if any of the tests yields a figure of the statutory amount 

aggregation- adding up value of claims

- 1p & 1d- aggregation- ok (add up value of all P's claims)

- P meets AIC & 2p (doesnt meet AIC) vs 1d- ok if ps claims related

- 1P vs multiple ds- must meet aic for each D (unless exception applies)
	exception:
	multiple Ps or Ds with common undivided interest & single title or right 
	(ex: joint ownership in land)

- A SINGLE P can aggregate claims both related and unrelated

class action
typicl lass act- some named class members need to meet the amt in controversey (remainder can aggregate)
class action fairness act (over $5 mil)
yes class action suit over $5 million, only minimzl diversity needed. if AIC less than 5 mil, ALL named parties must be diverse 

counterclaim
- if p's claim exceeds jurisdictional amount:
- - compulsory counterclaim may be heard regardless of the amount
- compulsory- same transaction or occurrence
- permissive CC- requires an independent jurisdictional basis 

28 U.S.C. §1367
A statute allowing federal courts with original subject matter jurisdiction to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over other claims that constitute the same case or controversy unless an express exception applies to the exercise of jurisdiction over such other claims.

[[In re Ameriquest Mortgage Co. Mortgage Lending Practices Litigation (2007)]]

[[Szendrey-Ramos v. First Bancorp (2007)]]

diversity j needs d of citizenship, complete diversity & amt in controversy requirement
- jurisdictional amount determined at the time complaint filed, does not matter how much is recovered. costs may be imposed/denied under 1332 (b)
- defense does not oust jurisdiction or show bad faith in regards to calculated amount in controversy 
- LPR qualifies as citizenship 


#### Removal 
28 U.S.C. §1441


cit ny sues against ny corp, fed statute, damages of 50k
has federal q j
but what if we add a state claim?- related to same facts 
yeee suppelemental jurisdiction

#### Supplemental Jurisdiction
[[28 U.S.C. §1367]]
- subsection a creates supplemental jurisdiction
- subsec b limits the use of supplemental j in diversity cases


district courts have supp j over so related claims that they form part or of same case or controversy under article III 

why supp j?- try whole case at once, avoid duplicative litigation, promotes judicial economy & efficiency 
28


how to determine so related to fed claim they support same case?
- common nucleus  of operative fact
- ordinarily would expect to try claims tg
- overlap in facts, evidence, witnesses, timing

why isnt it unconstitutional for a fed district courl to hear the state law claims?
- same case or controversy (Art III)

at what point in litigation is determination on supp j made? 
- when complaint is filed, look at pleadings

federal SMJ must be present over at least one (1) claim 

[[In re Ameriquest Mortgage Co. Mortgage Lending Practices Litigation (2007)]]
- claims relaated, discretionary factors not present

[[Szendrey-Ramos v. First Bancorp (2007)]]
- claims related but court declines to exercie over 28 usc 1367 (c)
- discretionary factors: state claims (novel & complex issues regarding puerto rican law)


**discretionary factors**: 
- even when supp j exists court can use discretion to decline
	1. novel or complex issue of state law
	2. state claim substantially predominates
	3. fed court original jurisdiction claims dismissed
	4. exceptional circumstances


tolling provision in 1367 (d)
- provides 30 day window to re-file in state court- tries to assist plaintiffs avoid losing claims due to statutes of limitations

- A, a citizen of Illinois, sues B, also a citizen of Illinois, alleging that B violated federal civil rights statutes in firing her. A seeks to add a state law claim alleging that her firing also violated a state wrongful discharge law. Is there supplemental jurisdiction? 
**yes

- A, a citizen of Illinois, sues B, also a citizen of Illinois, alleging that B violated federal civil rights statutes in firing her. A seeks to add a state law claim alleging that B negligently caused her injuries when his car backed into hers in the company parking lot. Is there supplemental jurisdiction? 
**no

- A, a citizen of Illinois, sues B, also a citizen of Illinois, alleging that B violated federal civil rights statutes by permitting co-workers to engage in sexual harassment. A invokes Rule 20 to join C, a co-worker from Illinois, who actually engaged in the harassment. State tort law is the basis of A’s claim against C. Because C is not A’s employer, the claim against him does not arise under federal law. Is there supplemental jurisdiction over the claim against C? 
**you can bring a claim forward over an additional individual , supp j over pendent party is expressly granted by last sentence in 1367(a)

- A, a citizen of Illinois, sues B, a citizen of Wisconsin, alleging breach of an employment contract and seeking a recovery in excess of $75,000. A invokes Rule 20 to join C, a citizen of Illinois; A alleges that C conspired with B to breach the employment contract. Is there supplemental jurisdiction over the claim against C? 
**no, c is joined as addiyonal defendant under rule 20 in a diversity-only case. 1367(b) withdraws grant of supp j since addded party desroys diveristy 

- Arthur, a citizen of New York, sues Barbara, a citizen of Pennsylvania, in federal district court. He alleges several claims: federal antitrust violations, federal securities law violations, and state law breach of contract. He alleges more than $100,000 in damages for each claim. Will the district court have to analyze how closely related the federal and state law claims are for purposes of deciding whether supplemental jurisdiction exists or whether any of the reasons in §1367(c) for declining to exercise jurisdiction apply? Why not?
**no, div supplies independent ground of fed j for state law claims and supp j will thus be necessary 

Legal issue- would a fed d court have subject matter j over a plaintiffs claim that her employer breached her employment k that is raised in her complaint along w her claim for wrongful teerminatio brought under a fedral statute when th plaintiff and the dfedendant are citizens of the same state


rule- fed court must have fed subject mattr j over all claims
since cara's employment discrimination claim under a fed statute the court clearly has fed q j over that claim. 

og SMJ over claim a
claim b = breach of k = state law claim
no rising under j
no fed q over added claim b
p citizen of ny and d citizen of ny 
no diversity between claim b parties

supplmenetal? 
og f SMJ 
additional claim- related
from same case or controversy
do claims arise from a common nucleus of operative fact
ordinarily
