# Personal Jurisdiction
Created: 2022-11-04 20:37

In contrast to SMJ (what is the case about, and does it belong in federal court?), - PJ focuses on the relationship between the defendant and forum state
- power of a state or fed court to compel a defendant to appear
- judgment entered without PJ is void 
- PJ- *WHERE* a defendant can be sued

- every civil action threatens parties with the possibility of taking their liberty or property
- lawsuits & the power of a court to do so raise concerns about due process
- defendant's relationship w FORUM state (where it was filed)
- nature of the claim (why the defendant was sued)
- relevant time period: BEFORE the suit was filed

•Physical presence of person or property in  
state can create PJ  
•Re: property  
	•Attach property when lawsuit commenced.  
•Re individuals  
	•Personally serve Defendant who is physically present in forum state.

- **in personam**- PJ over the person in the forum state
- **in rem**- PJ over the property in forum state 
- **quasi in rem**- D has property in forum, and property used to satisfy a judgement against D
