 a statute that a state can enact that sets the boundaries of who can use their courts. 
 
 - legislature of each state grants power to courts in the state to exercise PJ through jurisdictional statutes
 - long arm statutes cannot grant courts more authority than what is listed under US constitution
-----
1. first ask whether jurisdiction complies w the long arm statute of the state in which the court is sitting
		 if NO- no personal jurisdiction
1. if YES, look to whether jurisdiction is constitutional:
-  are there traditional bases?
- is citizenship fulfilled
- is there tag J
- consent or waiver
- min contacts, relatedness, pj reasonable
- substantial contacts & essentialy at home
-----
federal courts usually follow the long arm statute **of state in which they are located.**
in most instances federal courts have no more jurisdictional reach than state courts.
exceptions:
- federal securities laws
- federal interpleader act
-----
### Broad long arm statutes
- exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent w the constiution of the state or the united states (ex california)

### Enumerated long arm statutes
- jurisdiction llimited to specified instances
- typically narrower than the constiution or to the extent of the constitution

### Uniform interstate & international procedure Act 13 ULA 355
- 20 states follow this model
