# Minimum Contacts
Created: 2022-11-04 20:53

*“Due process requires only that in order to subject a  
defendant to a judgment in personam if he be not  
present within the territory of the forum, that he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”*
- Presence is a fiction – it just symbolizes the actions of a corporation
- Look to contacts or activities in the forum state. 
- In measuring contacts :  
	•Focus on actions of the D  
	•Unilateral activities of others insufficient to create PJ  
	•Look for Purposeful Availment of benefits & protections of forum state by D
- If nonresident D . . .  
	•Need minimum contacts such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play & substantial justice.

NO PJ | SPECIFIC PJ | GENERAL PJ 
--------- | ---------------------- | -----------------------------------
No contacts, casual & isolated contacts | single act, continuous, systematic contacts **contacts must be related to claim** | substantial, pervasive contacts ** PJ for all claims (related & unrelated)** 


Under what circumstances will a defendant always  
be subject to general jurisdiction?  
- Corporations?
	- Place of incorporation & 
	- Principal Place of Business
		- Nerve Center (headquarters)  
- Individuals?  
	- Domicile
		- Presence + intent to remain indefinitely

Thus, defendants are subject to PJ where they are a citizen  
- Corps = Place of Incorporation & Principal Place of Business  
- Individuals = Domicile (physical presence + intent to remain indefinitely)  
**AND**  
Where they have sufficient minimum contacts & PJ would be reasonable (fair).
- Corporations doing business in a state – can equal minimum contacts

**purposeful availment** of the benefits & protections of the forum state- "deliberately reaching out"
**reasonable anticipation**- fair warning so as to "structure primary conduct"

-selling cars, advertising & promoting products, retail outlets, providing parts & services, creating a market in the state; entering into contracts

contacts must arise out of or relate to claim
A contact can relate to a claim even without a causal relationship

focus on the defendant's actions, reasonable anticipation
- personal availment of the benefits & protections of the state
- targeting the market in the state
- efforts to serve the market in the state
- (eg sales, profits, employees, advertisements, etc.)
- contacts- RELATED TO CLAIM!
- creates predictability 

## Reasonableness Factors:
1. burden on (convenience) D
2. forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute 
	- providing a forum for citizens to sue
	- providing a forum for non resident injured ps
	- preventing corporations from coming to state committing torts without being subject to jurisdiction
3. P's interest in Convenient and effective relief
	- ability to pursue small claims in  a convenient forum
	- suing at home
4. interstate judicial systems interest in efficient resolution of controversies
	- location of evidence, witnesses, jurisdiction all over the parties, choice of law, or apply unfamiliar law
5. shared interest of the several states in furthering fundametal substantial social pollicies
	- non US d's
	- complicated non-US law

**minimum contacts required for nonresident Ds
- purposeful availment- targeting market, effort to serve market, reasonable anticipation

*minimum contacts such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play & substantial justice

#### minimum contacts + reasonablness factors = PJ

PJ based on contacts must illustrate:
- quality & nature of d's contacts
- more than casual or isolated and constitute a single act or be consistent and systematic
- purposefully avail or benefits & protections of forum state
- d reasonably anticipates being sued in forum
- claim must be related to arise out of contacts
