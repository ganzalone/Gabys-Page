- Common law doctrine
- Used by federal & state courts
- Court may dismiss the action and require the P to bring it in the more convenient forum.  

Ordinarily applied only when:  
• There is a court available in another judicial system that is substantially more convenient

Applies *Gilbert* analysis Balancing test  
• P’s choice of forum should rarely be disturbed  
• Choice forum given less force when real parties in interest are foreign  
• Choice of forum given greater deference when P sues at home.

## Private Interest
- court congestion- caseload
- Ease of access to sources of proof 
- Availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses
- Cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses 
- Possibility of view of premises 
- Other practical problems that make trial of case easy, expeditious, and inexpensive. 

## Public Interest Factors
- Local interest in resolving local controversies at home
- Forum that is at home with the law that governs the action
- Avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflict of laws or application of foreign law
- Unfairness of burdening citizens in unrelated forum to jury duty

## Dismissal
Court can dismiss when forum:
•Would establish oppressiveness and vexation to D  
•Out of proportion to P’s convenience; or  
•Choice of forum inappropriate

*Unfavorable substantive law in the alternative forum alone is not a sufficient grounds to refuse to dismiss the action under FNC doctrine*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FNC  
- PJ exists
- Venue is proper  
But . . .  
- **More fair** to dismiss action and have it refiled  
elsewhere  
• To obtain a FNC dismissal D must show:  
	• Alternative forum available  
	AND  
	• Private & public interest factors support dismissal.
	
-----------------------------
- Exception to usual preference given to P’s choice of forum
- Burden on D to justify FNC dismissal
- FNC presupposes that another court exists in which the action may be brought.  
	•No dismissal if no other court has PJ  
	•No FNC dismissal if action time barred  

*Note - FNC dismissal can be conditioned on the D’s agreement to submit to personal jurisdiction or waive statute of limitations objections in the alternative forum
