**Aggregation- adding up the value of claims

- 1p & 1d- aggregation- ok (add up value of all P's claims)

- P meets AIC & 2p (doesnt meet AIC) vs 1d- ok if ps claims related

- 1P vs multiple ds- must meet aic for each D (unless an exception applies)
	exception:
	multiple Ps or Ds with common undivided interest & single title or right 
	(ex: joint ownership in land)

- A SINGLE P can aggregate claims both related and unrelated
