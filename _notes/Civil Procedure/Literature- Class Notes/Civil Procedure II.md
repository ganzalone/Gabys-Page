Civil Procedure is Dispute Resolution!

- **Primary Goals of Dispute Resolution:
	- Accuracy
	- Efficiency
	- Finality
	- Neutrality
	- Equality
	- Fairness
	- Accessibility
	- Consistency
	- Reduce Bias & Prejudice
	- Transparency
- All states have at least one court of "general jurisdiction"
- Courts of Appeal set standards of review
- Issues of law: 
	- *de novo* - "anew", substitute judgement
	- issues of fact - clearly erroneous
	- issues of procedure - abuse of discretion (hard to overturn)

13 circuits, 94 judicial districts

What's at stake?
*for the client* : dignity, monetary relief, reputation, property, time, liberty, health, business
*for the system* : integrity, efficiency, justice



**Two types of cases:

1. Civil Cases
- Between private parties and/or the government
- seeking remedies (damages ($) injunctions, etc.)
- Standard of proof is "Preponderance of the Evidence", or "more likely than not"

2. Criminal Cases
- Cases brought by government (the people)
- Implications (fines, imprisonment)
- Standard of proof is "beyond a reasonable doubt"

**Stages of a Civil Lawsuit

1. Plaintiff files complaint- giving the defendant a copy = service
2. Defendant responds (no response = loss)
3. Discovery 
4. Resolution (settle, arbitration,dismissal, trial)
