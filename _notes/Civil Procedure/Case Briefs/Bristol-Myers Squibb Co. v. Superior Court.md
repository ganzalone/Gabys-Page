## Rule of Law

For a state court to assert specific jurisdiction, there must be an affiliation between the forum state and the specific claim at issue.

## Facts

The plaintiffs, residents of California and 33 other states, brought suit against Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (defendant) in California Superior Court. 

The plaintiffs asserted a number of claims, alleging that Plavix, a drug BMS manufactured, injured them. BMS was a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in New York. 

Plavix was not designed, developed, or manufactured in California. 

Further, the plaintiffs residing outside of California did not buy or take Plavix in California.

BMS moved to quash service of summons on those plaintiffs who were not California residents. The superior court denied the motion. The California Court of Appeal held that California courts had specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents’ claims. The California Supreme Court affirmed, finding specific jurisdiction because the claims and injuries of the resident plaintiffs were identical to those of the nonresident plaintiffs. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.


## Issue

For a state court to assert specific jurisdiction, must there be an affiliation between the forum state and the specific claim at issue?

## Holding and Reasoning (Alito, J.)

Yes. For a state court to assert specific jurisdiction, there must be an affiliation between the forum state and the specific claim at issue. It is not sufficient for the defendant to have other contacts with the forum state; the contacts must be related to the claim at issue. If the defendant’s conduct giving rise to the claim and the plaintiff’s injury both occur outside of the state, the court likely cannot assert specific jurisdiction. Further, the fact that the claims and injuries of resident plaintiffs are identical to those of nonresident plaintiffs is immaterial to the question of specific jurisdiction. In this case, the lower courts erred in finding that California state courts have specific jurisdiction over the nonresident plaintiffs’ claims. Although BMS has many contacts with California, none of those contacts is affiliated with the nonresident plaintiffs’ claims. BMS did not design, develop, or manufacture Plavix in California, and the nonresident plaintiffs did not buy or take Plavix in California. Thus, both the BMS conduct giving rise to the claims and the nonresident plaintiffs’ injuries occurred outside of California. There is no affiliation between California and the nonresident plaintiffs’ claims. Accordingly, California courts do not have specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents’ claims. The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.

## Dissent (Sotomayor, J.)

The majority’s holding will make it unnecessarily difficult for individual plaintiffs across multiple states to aggregate claims against a large defendant corporation that inflicts identical harms nationwide. There is nothing unfair about subjecting a national corporation to one single suit for damages incurred nationwide.
