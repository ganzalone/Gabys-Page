# In re Ameriquest Mortgage Co. Mortgage Lending Practices Litigation (2007)
Created: 2022-09-12 08:29

## Rule of Law

In any action in which the district court has jurisdiction over a federal claim, the district court also has supplemental jurisdiction over state claims that are so related to claims in the action that they form part of the same case or controversy.

## Facts

Barbara Skanes (plaintiff) alleged that she signed a mortgage with Ameriquest Mortgage Co. (Ameriquest) (defendant), which ordered an appraisal of the home Skanes was to purchase. Skanes alleged that Ameriquest and the appraiser (defendant) inflated the value of the home to increase the loan amount and therefore Ameriquest’s profit. In her complaint, Skanes asserted a federal claim under the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) and state-law claims for fraud. The appraiser moved to dismiss Skanes's state-law claims.

## Issue

Do state-law claims for fraud against a mortgage lender form part of the same case or controversy as a federal Truth-in-Lending Act claim against that lender?

## Holding and Reasoning (Aspen, J.)

Yes. The court has jurisdiction over the federal TILA claim, and it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law fraud claims if they are so related to the federal claims that they form part of the same case or controversy. In this case, this standard is satisfied. Skanes factually connected her federal and state-law claims so that if her state-law claims were dismissed, she might be unable to recover the amount of her allegedly overpaid mortgage under the TILA. A court has the discretion not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in four instances: (1) if the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law; (2) if the state law claim substantially predominates over the federal law claim; (3) if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; or (4) where there are other compelling circumstances to justify declining jurisdiction. As none of these situations are present in the instant case, the choice to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law fraud claim is appropriate. The motion to dismiss is denied.
