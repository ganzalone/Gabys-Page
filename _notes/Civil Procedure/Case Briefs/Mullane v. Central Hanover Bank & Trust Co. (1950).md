## Rule of Law

Notice must be reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.

## Facts

Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company (defendant) established a common trust fund, which pools multiple small trusts into one large fund for easier administration. Central Hanover petitioned the court for settlement of its first account as trustee. Beneficiaries of the trust were given notice by publication in a local newspaper in compliance with the minimum requirements of New York banking law. The court appointed Mullane (plaintiff) as special guardian of beneficiaries of the trust who had not appeared in response to the notice, and he objected that the notice was inadequate to provide due process. Nonetheless the court entered a final decree accepting the accounts, and Mullane appealed.

## Issue

Whether publication in a local newspaper is sufficient notice of the pendency of an account settlement to beneficiaries of a common trust.

## Holding and Reasoning (Jackson, J.)

No. The Due Process Clause requires that deprivation of life, liberty, or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing. The proceeding potentially deprives trust beneficiaries of property by cutting off their right to contest the administration of the trust and by having their income reduced by deductions for fees and expenses. Notice is constitutionally required to be reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. Such notice must reasonably convey the required information and must offer any interested parties a reasonable time to come forward. Here, under the circumstances, the notice was reasonably calculated to notify potentially interested parties of the pending litigation whose interests or addresses were unknown to the trustee and gave them sufficient opportunity to come forward with their claims. The number of beneficiaries and their identities were difficult or impossible to track. There were numerous unknown beneficiaries, and the rights were likely often transferred to other parties. The cost of tracking down these numerous beneficiaries for personal notice was enormous, and this burden should not be placed upon Central Hanover. Mullane adequately represented the interests of the parties who could not be identified, and the notice given in the newspaper was sufficient under the circumstances. However, notice by publication does not satisfy due process where the beneficiaries’ addresses and interests are known to the trustee. Here, the trustee has the names and addresses of the income beneficiaries represented by Mullane. There is no reason why the trustee should be permitted to dispense with a serious effort to inform these parties personally. Because the New York banking law permits notice by publication even to parties whose addresses and interests are known to the trustee, it is incompatible with the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process provision. The judgment of the lower court is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
