## Rule of Law

A district court has jurisdiction where the matter in controversy is between citizens of different states or citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state.

## Facts

Redner (plaintiff) was a citizen of the United States residing in France but was not a French citizen. Sanders (defendant) was a corporation with its principal place of business in New York. Redner asserted diversity jurisdiction, alleging that he was a resident of France and had a driver’s license, license to practice law, and owned a business located in California.

## Issue

Whether an individual can invoke diversity jurisdiction against a New York corporation if he resides in France and has contacts with California.

## Holding and Reasoning (Griesa, J.)

No. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 a district court has jurisdiction where the matter in controversy is between citizens of different states or citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state. Redner fails to establish that he is a citizen of a foreign state or a resident of a state of the United States other than New York. Simply residing in France does not establish him as a citizen, particularly without details about his residence, family, or professional activities in France. Furthermore, maintaining contacts with, regularly visiting, and retaining certain licenses in California is not sufficient to establish that one is domiciled there. There can be no diversity of jurisdiction on the basis of California domicile or French citizenship. The complaint is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
