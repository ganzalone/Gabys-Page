## Rule of Law

A court can assert general jurisdiction over a corporation if the corporation’s affiliations with the forum state are so continuous and systematic as to render the corporation at home in the state.

## Facts

Bauman, et al. (plaintiffs), residents of Argentina, brought suit against DaimlerChrysler AG (Daimler) (defendant) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MBA), a Daimler subsidiary, collaborated with Argentinian forces to kidnap, torture, and kill MBA workers during an Argentinian war. These workers were the plaintiffs or persons closely related to the plaintiffs. Daimler was a German company. MBA’s alleged actions took part solely outside of the United States. The plaintiffs based their claim of the district court’s jurisdiction on Daimler’s subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA), which was incorporated in Delaware and had its principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA distributed Daimler cars to all 50 states and had various facilities and offices in California. Daimler filed a motion to dismiss the claims based on lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court granted the motion. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and later reversed. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.

## Issue

Can a court assert general jurisdiction over a corporation if the corporation’s affiliations with the forum state are not so continuous and systematic as to render the corporation at home in the state?

## Holding and Reasoning (Ginsburg, J.)

No. **A court can assert general jurisdiction over a corporation if the corporation’s affiliations with the forum state are so continuous and systematic as to render the corporation at home in the state**

Examples of acceptable affiliations include, but are not limited to, a corporation’s place of incorporation and principal place of business. _International Shoe Co. v. Washington_, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), stated that such activities must be so substantial that they justify bringing suit “on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.” Here, Daimler’s affiliations with California are not so substantial that they justify this suit being heard there. Daimler and MBUSA are incorporated and have their principal places of business outside of California. Although MBUSA distributes cars to and maintains offices in California, MBUSA distributes cars to every state. If the Court were to grant the district court general jurisdiction based on that affiliation, this suit could also theoretically be heard in every state. Thus, the affiliations of MBUSA and Daimler with California are not so continuous and systematic as to render the companies at home in California. The court of appeals erred by granting the district court general jurisdiction over this suit. Accordingly, the ruling of the court of appeals is reversed.
