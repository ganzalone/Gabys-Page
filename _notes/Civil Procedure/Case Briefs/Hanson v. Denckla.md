# Hanson v. Denckla
Created: 2022-10-18 20:16

## Rule of Law

A defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction only if the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state.

## Facts

Dora Donner, a Pennsylvania resident, established a trust in Delaware with a Delaware bank as trustee. Subsequently Donner moved to Florida, where she died and where her will was then probated. One of Donner’s three daughters, Hanson (defendant), was executrix of Donner's will and the primary recipient of the Delaware trust. Donner's other daughters, Denckla (plaintiff) and Stewart, split the majority of the estate when the will was probated in Florida. Denckla wished the Florida court to exercise jurisdiction over the Delaware trust and trustee, in which case Hanson would have no share of the estate. The Florida court assumed jurisdiction over the Delaware trust and enjoined the Delaware trust from paying. The Florida Supreme Court upheld the decision that Florida law applied to determine the validity of the Delaware trust. Meanwhile, Hanson had filed a separate suit in Delaware. The Delaware court ruled, among other things, that the trust was valid under Delaware law. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the Florida judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit because Florida lacked jurisdiction over the trust res and had no personal jurisdiction over the Delaware trustee. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.

## Issue

Is a defendant subject to personal jurisdiction only if the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state?

## Holding and Reasoning (Warren, C.J.)

Yes. Courts only have personal jurisdiction over defendants who have minimal contacts to the state. The unilateral activities of someone in the state who claims a relationship with a nonresident defendant are not sufficient to satisfy this minimal-contacts requirement. Rather, a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction only if it purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state. By conducting activities in the forum state, the defendant calls upon the benefits and protections of the state's laws. Here, the Florida court could not exercise personal jurisdiction over the Delaware trustee. The trustee did nothing to purposefully avail itself of the benefits or protections of Florida's laws. The trustee had no office in Florida, it transacted no business there, it held no trust assets there, and it solicited no business there. As the trustee did not have substantial contacts with Florida, the Florida court lacks jurisdiction over the Delaware trust. The decision of the Florida court is reversed as void under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Delaware court was not required to give full faith and credit to the invalid Florida judgment, and the Delaware court's decision is affirmed.

## Dissent (Black, J.)

The minimum-contacts requirement ensures that a court's exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant does not offend "traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice." Int'l Shoe v. Washington﻿, 326 U.S. 310 (1945). Here, there is nothing unfair about the Florida court exercising jurisdiction over the trustee. Florida played an expansive role in the dispute at issue. The trustee had business relations with Donner for the eight years that she lived in Florida, and the trustee regularly communicated with Donner about trust business during that time.
