# McGee v. International Life Insurance Co.
Created: 2022-10-18 20:15


## Rule of Law

A state court has jurisdiction over an out-of-state company if the company has substantial connections with the state.

## Facts

Franklin, a resident of California, purchased a life insurance policy from International, a Texas company with no offices or agents located in California. Franklin paid his premiums until his death, after which International refused to pay on the ground that Franklin had committed suicide. McGee, the beneficiary of Franklin’s life insurance policy (plaintiff) brought suit in California against International Life Insurance Co. (defendant) in California state court and McGee was awarded a judgment. Unable to collect in California, McGee filed in state court in Texas but was rebuffed there due to improper service. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.

## Issue

Whether a California court has jurisdiction over a Texas insurance company when the company denies a claim of a California resident.

## Holding and Reasoning (Black, J.)

Yes. Under precedent cases, a state court has jurisdiction over an out-of-state company if that company has substantial connections with the state. The California court has jurisdiction over International because of International’s connection with California. The life insurance contract was delivered to a California resident, and California has an interest in protecting the interests of its insured residents. It is not an undue burden on International to respond to allegations in California given the state of the national economy. The decision of the lower court is reversed and remanded.
