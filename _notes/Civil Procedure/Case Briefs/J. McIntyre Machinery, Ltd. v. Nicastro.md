# J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro
Created: 2022-10-18 20:18

## Rule of Law

For a defendant to be subject to a state’s personal jurisdiction, it must purposefully avail itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.

## Facts

New Jersey resident Robert Nicastro (plaintiff) became seriously injured while using a metal-shearing machine manufactured by J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre) (defendant). Although the injury occurred in New Jersey, the machine was manufactured in England where J. McIntryre is incorporated. The New Jersey Supreme Court found that, even though J. McIntyre never marketed its goods in the state nor shipped them there, New Jersey courts had jurisdiction over the company because the manufacturer knew or should have reasonably known that its products were distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead their products being sold in any of the 50 states, including New Jersey. J. McIntyre appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review.

## Issue

For a defendant to be subject to a State’s personal jurisdiction, must it purposefully avail itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws?

## Holding and Reasoning (Kennedy, J.)

Yes. It has been held that a court may subject a defendant to its jurisdiction only when the defendant has sufficient contacts in the forum state “such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” _International Shoe Co. v. Washington_, 326 U.S. 310 (1945). Generally, the Court’s exercise of power requires some act on behalf of the defendant to purposefully avail itself “of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.” _Hanson v. Denckla_, 357 U.S. 235 (1958). Such activities may include actual presence in the state when the suit is commenced, citizenship or domicile in the state, and incorporation or having a place of business within the state. Conversely, those who live or operate outside of a state have a right not to be subjected to judgment in its courts. In _Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty._, 480 U.S. 102 (1987), the Court constructed a different approach. There, Justice Brennan’s concurrence contended that a defendant that placed a product into the stream of commerce may be subject to a State’s jurisdiction “[a]s long as a participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum State . . . . ” Justice O’Connor’s concurrence noted that “[t]he ‘substantial connection’ between the defendant and the forum state necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.” _Id._ at 112. Despite the lack of clarity put forth by _Asahi_, the Court’s precedents make clear that it is the defendant’s actions, not expectations, that allow a State’s courts to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. It is true that in some instances a defendant may be subject to the federal courts due to a relationship with the federal government but not to a court of any particular state. But that is an exception, not the rule. Here, J. McIntyre did not engage in any conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey. Consequently, it cannot be subjected to the jurisdiction of a New Jersey court. The judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is reversed.
