## Rule of Law

Supplemental jurisdiction should not be exercised over claims that posit novel and complex issues of state law or substantially predominate over the federal claims.

## Facts

Carmen Szendrey-Ramos (plaintiff) was general counsel for First Bancorp (defendant). She received a report from another law firm alleging that bank officials possibly committed ethical and legal violations in accounting for bulk purchases of mortgages from other financial institutions. She conducted an investigation and concluded that there had been ethical violations and reported her findings to the bank’s outside counsel, along with bank officials and the Board of Directors. Szendrey-Ramos sued under Title VII of federal employment law and Puerto Rico’s laws and constitution when she was fired following these revelations.

## Issue

Should a federal district court exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that posit novel and complex issues of state law or substantially predominate over the federal claims?

## Holding and Reasoning (Casellas, J.)

No. **Supplemental jurisdiction should not be exercised over claims that posit novel and complex issues of state law or substantially predominate over the federal claims.** Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), a district court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that are so related to the claims over which the court has original jurisdiction that they are part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the U.S. Constitution. However, even if a court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim, 

**28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) allows a court to decline to exercise jurisdiction if (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law, (2) the claim substantially predominates over the federal claims, (3) the district court has dismissed all the claims in the action over which it has original jurisdiction, or (4) there are other compelling reasons not to exercise jurisdiction.**

Here, the number of claims under Puerto Rican law substantially outnumber the two claims under Title VII, and the elements of the latter are insufficient to establish claims under the former. Moreover, the claims arising under Puerto Rican law raise the issue of whether Szendrey-Ramos violated the Puerto Rican Code of Professional Ethics, a novel and complex issue of state law that is best adjudicated in state court. Therefore, the claims under Puerto Rican law are dismissed without prejudice so they can be re-entered in the appropriate court. However, the Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims survive and may go forward.
