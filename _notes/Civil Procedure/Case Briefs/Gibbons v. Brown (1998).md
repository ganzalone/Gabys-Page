## Rule of Law

The plaintiff must allege sufficient jurisdictional facts within the coverage of the long-arm statute and must show sufficient minimum contacts with the state to satisfy due process.

## Facts

Gibbons (defendant), a Texas resident, and the Browns, Florida residents, were driving in Montreal, Canada. Gibbons was giving Mr. Brown directions, but she gave Brown wrong directions and Brown collided head-on with an oncoming vehicle on a one way street. Gibbons sued Mr. Brown in Florida for injuries she sustained, and Ms. Brown (plaintiff) later sued Gibbons in Florida for injuries she alleged were caused by Gibbons’ faulty directions.

## Issue

Whether bringing a prior suit under the same transaction is a sufficient basis for jurisdiction over the same party as a defendant under a long-arm statute.

## Holding and Reasoning (Per Curiam)

No. In order to acquire jurisdiction over a defendant under a long-arm statute, the plaintiff must allege sufficient jurisdictional facts within the coverage of the long-arm statute and must show sufficient minimum contacts with the state to satisfy due process. Brown alleged as a basis for Florida jurisdiction over Gibbons that Gibbons had subjected herself to the personal jurisdiction of Florida courts by bringing the prior lawsuit. Gibbons had filed her suit two years prior to Ms. Brown filing hers. Moreover, Ms. Brown was not even a party to Gibbons’ suit. Ms. Brown made no other showing of activity in which Gibbons engaged in Florida making the jurisdictional standard unsatisfied. Ms. Brown’s suit is dismissed.
