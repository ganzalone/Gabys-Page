# World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson
Created: 2022-10-18 20:17

## Rule of Law

Foreseeability alone is not sufficient to authorize a state court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant that has no contacts, ties, or relations with the forum state.

## Facts

Harry and Kay Robinson purchased a car from World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. (World-Wide) in New York while they were still residents of that state. The next year the family left New York to move to Arizona. 

On the way they were struck by a car in Oklahoma. Mrs. Robinson and her children were severely burned in the car crash. The Robinsons brought a products-liability suit against World-Wide, claiming that the fire was a result of the defective design of the car. 

World-Wide made a special appearance to the district court, claiming that Oklahoma's exercise of jurisdiction over them violated the company's due process rights. World-Wide, a New York corporation, conducted no business in the State of Oklahoma. 

The district court ruled against World-Wide. World-Wide (plaintiff) then sought a writ of prohibition in the Supreme Court of Oklahoma to stop the district court’s Judge Woodson (defendant) from exercising personal jurisdiction over them. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma denied the writ. World-Wide then petitioned the United States Supreme Court and the case was granted certiorari.

## Issue

Is foreseeability alone sufficient to authorize a state court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant that has no contacts, ties, or relations with the forum state?

## Holding and Reasoning (White, J.)

No. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits the power of a state court to assert personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant. _See_ _Kulko v. Superior Court_, 436 U.S. 84 (1978). According to the court in _International Shoe Co. v. Washington_, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), a state court may only exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant if the defendant has sufficient contacts with the forum state. The relationship between a non-resident defendant and the forum state must be such that it is reasonable to require the non-resident to come to the state to defend the action. Here, the plaintiffs had no contacts, ties, or relations with the State of Oklahoma. The only basis for the district court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs is the fact that the automobile, which was sold in the State of New York to New York residents, was involved in an accident in Oklahoma. That the plaintiffs could foresee the automobile’s use in Oklahoma is not sufficient to authorize the state court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction. In _Kulko_, the court explained that foreseeability in a due process analysis refers to whether the defendant’s contacts with the forum state are such that he should reasonably expect being subject to the jurisdiction of the state’s courts. In this case, because the plaintiffs conducted no activities in Oklahoma, it is unreasonable to say that they should have anticipated being haled into an Oklahoma state court. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is reversed.

## Dissent (Brennan, J.)

When determining its personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, a court may consider the interest of the forum state in proceeding with the case, and the actual burden the defendant must bear in defending the action in the state, in addition to the defendant’s contacts with the state. _See_ _McGee v. International Life Insurance Co._, 355 U.S. 220 (1957). Further, the minimum contacts test established in _International Shoe_ may be outdated. 

Given modern realities, fairness and reasonableness no longer require the extreme concern for non-resident defendants that was necessary at the time that case was decided. 

Here, the State of Oklahoma has a legitimate interest in proceeding with this case because it involves the enforcement of its traffic laws. Additionally, defending this action in Oklahoma would not unduly inconvenience the plaintiffs. Finally, the plaintiffs are not wholly unconnected with the State of Oklahoma. They sell automobiles that, by their very nature, are mobile and capable of traveling to distant states. Therefore, when the plaintiffs sold the automobile to the Robinsons, they purposefully injected the automobile into the stream of interstate commerce. In cases such as this, where the non-resident defendant’s contacts with the forum state are less significant, but the state has a strong interest in proceeding with the case and the defendant is not unfairly burdened by defending the action in the forum state, a state court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defendant may be justified.
