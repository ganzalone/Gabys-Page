# LOUISVILLE & NASHVILLE RAILROAD v. MOTTLEY (1908)
Created: 2022-08-28 18:11

##### aug 28, pg 210 
*211 U.S. 149 (1908)*

Plaintiff(s): Mottley
Defendant(s): L & N Railroad

### Procedural history:
The Mottleys sued in federal court seeking specific performance of their settlement. Alleges: First, that the act of Congress referred to does not prohibit the giving of passes under the circumstances of this case; and, second, that if the law is to be construed as prohibiting such passes, it is in conflict with the Fifth Amendment of the constitution, because it deprives the plaintiffs of their property without due process of law. The defendant demurred to the bill. The federal trial court overruled the demurrer and granted the Mottleys the relief they had requested. Defendant railroad appealed to the Supreme Court. 

### Facts:

Erasmus and Annie Mottley were injured in a railway accident. To settle their claims, the railroad in 1871 gave them a lifetime pass good for free transportation on the line. Several decades later, Congress, believing that railroads were using free transportation to bribe public officials, made free passes unlawful. The railroad thereupon refused to honor the Mottleys’ passes, citing the new federal legislation. 

### Rule of law:
The rule is a reasonable and just one that the complainant in the first instance shall be confined to a statement of its cause of action, leaving to the defendant to set up in his answer what his defense is and, if anything more than a denial of complainant’s cause of action, imposing upon the defendant the burden of proving such defense.
-well-pleaded complaint rule 

### Issue:
Two large questions, but the real issue is: 
was the court below acting within jurisdiction ? 

### Holding:
no they were not RIP

### Rationale:
There was no diversity of citizenship and it is not and cannot be suggested that there was any ground of jurisdiction, except that the case was a “suit. . . . arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.”
It is the settled interpretation of these words, as used in this statute, conferring jurisdiction, that **a suit arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States only when the plaintiff’s statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon those laws or that Constitution.** It is **not enough** that the plaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is invalidated by some provision of the Constitution of the United States. Although such allegations show that very likely, in the course of the litigation, a question under the Constitution would arise, they do not show that the suit, that is, the plaintiff’s original cause of action, arises under the Constitution.

(basically, u cant anticipate a defense. the complaint, on its face, must raise a federal question. Anticipating that the defense is invalidated by some provision of the Constitution is insufficient. It is not enough that a federal question may arise in  the court of the trial of the case.)

### Judgement:
It is ordered that the judgment be reversed and the case remitted to the circuit court with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.
