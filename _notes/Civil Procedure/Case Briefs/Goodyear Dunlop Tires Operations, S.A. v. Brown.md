## Rule of Law

A state court may not exercise general jurisdiction over a foreign subsidiary of a United States-based corporation unless it engages in such continuous and systematic activities as to render it essentially at home in the forum state.

## Facts

Two 13-year-old boys from North Carolina, Julian Brown and Matthew Helms, were killed in a bus accident outside Paris, France. The boys’ parents (plaintiffs) filed a wrongful-death suit in North Carolina state court against The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear USA), an Ohio corporation, and three of its subsidiaries organized and operating exclusively in Turkey, France, and Luxembourg (subsidiaries) (defendants). The parents alleged that a defective tire manufactured in Goodyear's Turkey plant was the cause of the accident. Although Goodyear USA regularly conducted business in North Carolina and agreed to submit to the court’s jurisdiction, its subsidiaries did not. The subsidiaries argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction over them and filed a motion in the trial court to dismiss the claims. The trial court denied the motion, and the subsidiaries appealed. The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to review.

## Issue

May a state court exercise general jurisdiction over a foreign subsidiary of a United States-based corporation if it does not engage in continuous and systematic activities in the forum state?

## Holding and Reasoning (Ginsburg, J.)

No. In _International Shoe Co. v. Washington_, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), the Court held that a state may authorize its courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant if the defendant has “certain minimum contacts with [the state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” In an attempt to more narrowly define the terms “fair play and substantial justice,” the _International Shoe_ Court classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants. 

The first specific-jurisdiction classification involves instances in which the defendant’s in-state activity is “continuous and systematic” and that activity gives rise to the episode underlying the suit. 
The second specific-jurisdiction classification involves the occurrence of certain “single or occasional acts” in a state that may be sufficient to jurisdictionally bind a defendant with respect to those acts.

In contrast to these specific-jurisdiction classifications, the _International Shoe_ Court identified circumstances in which a defendant's continuous corporate activity within a state is substantial enough to justify a suit against the defendant even if the cause of action has nothing to do with its in-state corporate activities. In these circumstances, a court may exercise general jurisdiction over the defendant. For an individual, this place of general jurisdiction is the individual's domicile. 

**For a corporation, it is the place in which the corporation is regarded at home, such as its place of incorporation or principal place of business.** 

In this case, the North Carolina courts relied on the subsidiaries placing tires into the “stream of commerce” to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over them in the state. However, merely placing a product into the stream of commerce in a state is not enough to subject the entity to suits unrelated to that activity. In _Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co._, 342 U.S. 437 (1952), an Ohio court could exercise general jurisdiction over a Philippine mining corporation where the corporation had its company files in Ohio, and the company's president maintained an Ohio office and supervised others from that location. By contrast, in _Helicopteros_ _Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall_, 466 U.S. 408 (1984), survivors of United States citizens who died in a helicopter crash could not maintain a wrongful-death action in Texas state court against the Columbian corporation that owned and operated the helicopter because the Colombian corporation had no place of business in Texas and was not licensed to conduct business in the state. Although the corporation made some purchases in Texas, these activities failed to achieve the required 

**“continuous and systematic business contacts” **

noted in _Perkins_. Comparing the facts of this case to _Helicopteros_ and _Perkins_, it is clear that North Carolina is not a forum in which the subsidiaries are at home. 

**The subsidiaries' sale of some tires in North Carolina through intermediaries is not a continuous, systematic business contact with the state sufficient to warrant the exercise of general jurisdiction over them.**

Accordingly, the appellate court's judgment is reversed.
