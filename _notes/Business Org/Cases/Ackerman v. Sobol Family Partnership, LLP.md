*4 A.3d 288 (2010)*

Plaintiff(s):
Defendant(s):

### Procedural history:
The Sobol parties moved to enforce the settlement agreement. The court granted the motion, finding that Coe had apparent settlement authority. The Ackermans appealed.

### Facts:
Rena Sobol Ackerman (Ackerman) and the trustees of her trust (collectively, the Ackermans) (plaintiffs) filed actions against individual members of the Sobol family, Sobol-family partnership and management companies, and Bank of America, N.A (the bank) (collectively, the Sobol parties) (defendants). Attorney Glenn Coe represented the Ackermans at mediation, rejected the Sobol parties’ settlement offer, counteroffered on behalf of the Ackermans, was observed conferring with Ackerman at a hearing, had a series of conversations with the Sobol parties’ attorneys in which he made a global offer and repeated assurances that he had settlement authority, and was observed conferring with Ackerman before the bank accepted the offer. Ackerman never indicated that Coe lacked authority to settle the litigation. 


### Rule of law:
If an attorney has apparent settlement authority, the client is bound by a settlement offer made or accepted by the attorney.

### Issue:
If an attorney has apparent settlement authority, is the client bound by a settlement offer made or accepted by the attorney?

### Holding:
Yes. If an attorney has apparent settlement authority, the client is bound by a settlement offer made or accepted by the attorney. Agency principles apply to the attorney-client relationship. A principal is bound by acts in which his agent engages with actual or apparent authority within the scope of the agent’s employment. An agent has actual authority when the principal expressly authorizes or ratifies the act. Apparent authority is the appearance of authority a principal causes or allows other people to believe his agent possesses. _Tomlinson v. Board of Education_, 629 A.2d 333 (Conn. 1993), established a two-pronged test for determining the existence of apparent authority: (1) it must appear from the principal’s conduct that the principal held the agent out as possessing sufficient authority to act or knowingly permitted the agent to act as having such authority, and (2) the party dealing with the agent must have reasonably believed that the agent had the authority to bind the principal. Under the Restatement (Third), The Law Governing Lawyers, an attorney with apparent authority may enter into a settlement agreement that binds the client. Rules of Professional Conduct (RPCs) 1.2(a), 1.4(a)(1), and 4.1, respectively, require a lawyer to abide by his client’s settlement decision, consult with and obtain the client’s consent before acting on a matter requiring informed consent, and be truthful when dealing with others on a client’s behalf. A settlement agreement in a Vermont case was held unenforceable because the client expressly authorized his attorney to settle the case for one amount and did not manifest that the attorney was authorized to settle the case for six times that amount. 

### Rationale:
Here, the settlement agreement is enforceable under _Tomlinson_. The course of dealing involving the Ackermans, Coe, and the Sobol parties’ attorneys supports the finding that the Ackermans held Coe out as having sufficient authority to settle the litigation. The Vermont case is distinguishable; there was no course of dealing by which the client indicated his attorney had authority to settle for the higher amount. The Sobol parties reasonably believed that Coe had apparent settlement authority. Coe rejected a settlement offer and made a counteroffer. The Ackermans never indicated that Coe lacked authority to make offers on their behalf. Instead, Ackerman was seen conferring with Coe on multiple occasions. Coe was required to comply with the RPCs, and attorneys for the Sobol parties reasonably relied on Coe’s assurances that he had settlement authority. 

### Judgement:
The judgment is affirmed.
