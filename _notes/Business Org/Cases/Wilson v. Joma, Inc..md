### Procedural history:

### Facts:
Carl L. Wilson (plaintiff) was struck by James DeMaio while DeMaio was driving his motorcycle to pick up lunch for himself and some coworkers during his lunch break. DeMaio was an employee of Joma, Inc. (defendant) d/b/a Three J’s Discount Tire and Gas Center, an automobile service station. At times, DeMaio served Joma in a supervisory capacity. Routinely, supervisors at Joma left the station during their lunch break to pick up lunch for themselves and nonsupervisory employees. Nonsupervisory employees were not permitted to leave the station during business hours. Wilson filed suit against Joma, claiming that DeMaio was acting within the course and scope of his employment while picking up lunch on his break. The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of Joma, finding that its employee was not acting within the scope of his employment during his lunch break. Wilson appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.

### Rule of law:
If the personal business of an employee is combined with the business of his employer, the employer is liable to third parties injured by its employee if the employee is acting within the course and scope of employment.

### Issue:
If the personal business of an employee is combined with the business of his employer, is the employer liable to third parties injured by its employee if the employee is acting within the course and scope of employment?

### Holding:
Yes. If the personal business of an employee is combined with the business of his employer, the employer is liable to third parties injured by its employee if the employee is acting within the course and scope of employment. If an employee is performing a task for the benefit of an employer, the mere fact the task also benefits the employee does not negate the employer’s liability under respondeat superior. If an employer escaped liability any time an employee’s conduct benefitted both the company and the employee personally, it would lead to an absurd result. 

### Rationale:
In this case, Joma does not have a formal policy requiring DeMaio, as a supervisor, to pick up lunch for other employees, but such practice is routine. In fact, the practice serves Joma’s interests in keeping employees on the premises during business hours so as to avoid inconveniencing its customers. Therefore, a jury may find that DeMaio was acting for the dual purposes of both Joma and himself in picking up his and his coworkers’ lunches. If so, then DeMaio is acting within the course and scope of his employment. 

### Judgement:
Thus, summary judgment is inappropriate, and the judgment of the lower court is reversed
