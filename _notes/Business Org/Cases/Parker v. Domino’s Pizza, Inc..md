Defendant(s):

### Procedural history:

### Facts:

### Rule of law:
An employee is not an independent contractor if the employer’s right to control the activities of an employee extends to the manner in which a task is to be performed.

### Issue:
Is an employee an independent contractor if the employer’s right to control the activities of an employee extends to the manner in which a task is to be performed.

### Holding:
No. An employee is not an independent contractor if the employer’s right to control the activities of an employee extends to the manner in which a task is to be performed. Independent contractors are distinct from employees in that independent contractors retain control over the manner in which to perform their work. Employees are subject to a much higher degree of control of their conduct by the employer. Principals are generally not liable for the torts of independent contractors because they lack the right to control an independent contractor’s physical conduct. 

### Rationale:
In this case, Domino’s provides incredible levels of detail on how its franchisees are to conduct business, down to the number of minutes they are permitted for their delivery zones and how to cut pizzas. The franchise agreement and operations manual are so specific that Domino’s retains control over nearly every aspect of operations.

### Judgement:
Therefore, Domino’s retains the right to control, which weighs heavily in favor of a finding that J & B Enterprises was not an independent contractor. The case is reversed and remanded to the lower court.
