### Procedural history:

### Facts:
Hoddeson (plaintiff) visited a store owned by Koos Bros. (defendant) to buy bedroom furniture. When Hoddeson entered the store, a man wearing a suit asked her if he could be of assistance. Hoddeson told the man that she intended to buy certain items that she had previously picked out. The man produced a pad, commenced writing, and told Hoddeson that he calculated $168.50 as the total price for the furniture. Hoddeson gave the man the full amount in cash, but did not receive a receipt. The man told Hoddeson that the items she purchased were out of stock, but would be delivered to her approximately one month hence. The furniture was not delivered, and Koos Bros. refused to issue a refund to Hoddeson, claiming that they had no record of Hoddeson’s purchase. Hoddeson sued Koos Bros. for a full refund. At trial, Hoddeson argued that she had interacted with a Koos Bros. salesman. Koos Bros. argued that they were not liable to Hoddeson because the man who took Hoddeson’s money had impersonated a store salesman without Koos Bros.’ knowledge. The trial court found in favor of Hoddeson.

### Rule of law:
A proprietor has a duty of care to customers and is liable for a customer’s monetary loss caused by an unauthorized person posing as the proprietor’s agent, if the proprietor could have prevented the loss but failed to do so.

### Issue:
Is a proprietor liable to a customer for money lost to an unauthorized person who convincingly pretends to be the proprietor’s agent?

### Holding:
Yes. A proprietor has a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent customers from being defrauded by unauthorized persons. When a proprietor allows a non-agent to swindle a customer under circumstances in which an average person would believe that the non-agent was acting on the proprietor’s behalf, the proprietor is estopped from denying liability for the non-agent’s actions. 

### Rationale:
Hoddeson alleges that she was defrauded in a Koos Bros’ store by a man dressed as a salesman who led Hoddeson to the furniture department and appeared to complete the sale of Hoddeson’s desired bedroom furniture. This court believes that a new trial should be held to provide Hoddeson the opportunity to plead and prove that Koos Bros. created an “agency by estoppel” by breaching their duty of care to her. 

### Judgement:
Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and a new trial is ordered.
