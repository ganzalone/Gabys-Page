### Procedural history:

### Facts:
Mary and Walter Stefanovicz (defendants) own a farm as tenants in common. Mary and Walter each have an undivided half interest in the farm. When Mary and Walter purchased the farm, Walter attended to many of the business matters of running the farm, including paying the mortgage, taxes, and insurance. Botticello (plaintiff) subsequently visited the farm and commenced negotiations with Walter to buy it. Walter and Mary discussed selling the farm, and Mary said that she would not sell it for less than $85,000. Botticello and Walter agreed to a price of $85,000 and executed a lease with an option to purchase the farm. Walter signed the lease/option-to-purchase agreement (Agreement) on his own, without representing that he was acting on behalf of Mary. After taking possession of the farm, Botticello regularly paid rent and openly made extensive improvements to the property. Several years later, Botticello exercised the option to buy the farm. Walter and Mary refused to honor the purchase option and Botticello sued to enforce it. At trial, Botticello argued that regardless of whether a principal-agent relationship existed between Mary and Walter, the Agreement was binding on Mary because her actions, including accepting Botticello’s rent payments and acknowledging his land improvements, showed that she had ratified it. The trial court decided in favor of Botticello and ordered specific performance of the Agreement.

### Rule of law:
Ratification of an act allegedly done on behalf of a person by another requires that the person accept the results of the act with intent to ratify and complete understanding of the material circumstances of the act.

### Issue:
Does a person’s acceptance of the benefits of an agreement to which she was not a party constitute ratification of that agreement?

### Holding:
No. The mere receiving of benefits, without more, does not prove ratification of an agreement. A person’s acceptance of benefits can be illustrative of ratification if an intent to ratify and knowledge of material circumstances are also proven, which they were not in this case. 

### Rationale:
Botticello argues that by accepting his rent payments and acknowledging his property improvements, Mary demonstrated her intent to ratify the Agreement and displayed knowledge of the material circumstances surrounding it. This court disagrees. Mary’s actions do not indicate intent to be bound to the Agreement, nor do they show that she understood all the relevant circumstances of the Agreement. Mary’s actions simply illustrate that she knew that Botticello’s rent payments and development of the property were pursuant to an agreement she had not signed and concerned land in which she has one-half interest. Moreover, Walter did not represent that he was acting on behalf of Mary when he negotiated and signed the Agreement.

### Judgement:
 Because there is no evidence that Mary ratified the Agreement, the trial court’s holding against her is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to rule in her favor.
