Acquisition by discovery

Johnson v M’Intosh (1823)

British crown takes priority over Native Americans’ chain of title

U.S. title “valid” because of “right of discovery” or rather, conquest

Conquest creates title

N.A. = conquerees 

U.S. title thus superior

  
  

Pierson v Post 

The fox!

  

How to define “pursuit”

Whoever land it is on first has priority/ possession is granted

Externalities exist when a person makes a decision on how to use resources without taking full account of the effects of the decision. These effects may be ignored as the costs or benefits may fall on others- they are “external” to the individual. Consequently resources may be misallocated. 

  

Negative & positive externalities

  

Purpose of property rights is to enhance social welfare by maximizing the value of scarce resources. Done by “internalizing externalities” brings cost of the use of a resource unto the user-

1.  Puts cost onto user, pushes user to be more efficient w resources
    
2.  reduces costs of negotiating over other externalities
    

  

When transaction cost becomes high enough external effects are likely to be overlooked and resources are misused. 

  

Adverse possession 

  

Exclusive (must be used by one, and not by rightful owner)  
Continuous (must consistently be contributing to land)  
Hostility (be without permission)  
Open (owner notices or may not)

  

Statute of limitations- time left to bring a suit

  

Claim of title- expresses requirement of hostility or claim of right on the part of an adverse possessor

  

Color of title- claim founded on a written instrument, judgement, or decree that is defective and invalid. 

  
  

Everett’s Lake Corp v Dye

  

Facts: Dye owns land that abuts the lake owned by Everett’s Lake Corp. Lake corp has fishing club that charges people to fish. Dye, living on the lake, fishes on his own. Lake Corp sues. 

  

Issue: Does Dye’s ownership of land grant him riparian rights?

  

Chain of Title

  
  

Defendant (Dye)

Plaintiff (Lake Corp)

-1948 Lambs own all land and lake, as well as rights to use lake for non-commercial purposes

-Given to Entwistles in 1948

-1988 given to Bakers

-1989 given to Threadgills 

-2015 given to Dye

(conveyance gives tract and rights

-1958 Lambs convey lake deed “imperspective of the method by which such rights may have been acquired” (about others)

  

Procedure: Trial court rules in favor of defendant. Plaintiff appeals, goes to superior court

  

Holding: Affirmed

  

Rationale: “bundle of sticks” property ownership is also the rights that come along with it

  
  
  

Manillo v. Gorski

  

Maine rule- wrongdoers only for adverse possession 

Connecticut rule- fair to wrongdoers & honest landowners

  

If removal is involved, it becomes a damages issue- pay a fine rather than tear down. 

  

Remand- sent back to lower court

Over “question of fact”

  

Howard v. Kunto

  

Jan 26 2022

  

Key AP elements (AP = adverse possession) 

1.  Exclusive not shared w rightful owner or anyone else
    
2.  Continuous- regular use 
    
3.  Hostile- w/o permission of rightful owner (posessor’s state of mind irrelevant, hostile even if possessor thought it was theirs)
    
4.  Open- rightful owner either knows (actual notice) or should know (constructive notice)
    

(ECHO)

  

10 yr statute

Open 12 years if continuous

8 if not

  

All 4 elements for the years set in statute of limitations

  

Tacking years together from adverse possession, only if there is PRIVitY between the two parties (reasonable connection)

Such as a sale or inheritance

  

Seasonal use- continuity is determined by what is typical for that type of property.

  

Principle 1- continuity can include seasonal use

  

Disability- statute of limitations extended if disability is present 5 years from end of disability (if more than one, from first disability) 

Course of action accrues when acquisition begins.

  

Ex:

  

AP begins 1995

AP starts and O is insane

O dies and intestate in 2008

Disability ends when O dies

Statute +5 years, runs out in 2013

  

Disability must BEGIN when cause of action begins

QUESTIONS FROM MY LAST PROPERTY 1 EXAM

  
  

Questions 1-5 are governed by the law of the State of Confusion.   Confusion adverse possession law is as follows: 

  

“An action to recover title to real property shall be brought within seven years after the cause thereof accrued, but if a person entitled to bring such action, at the time the cause thereof accrues, is a minor or imprisoned, such person may bring such action within five years after such disability is removed.” 

  

1.  A man began adverse possession of a neighbor’s property in 2013.  In 2017, the neighbor began a prison sentence. IRRELEVANT BECAUSE DISABILITY STARTS AFTER CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES  In 2021, the neighbor sues for ejectment.  Which of these statements is most accurate? 

  

a) The neighbor’s suit is not time-barred because of the prison sentence  WRONG BC PRISON SENTENCE IRRELEVANT

b) the statute of limitations ran out in 2020    RIGHT 2013+7 = 2020

c) the statute of limitations will run out in 2022 DISABILITY DOES NOT MATTER

d) if the neighbor dies in 2018, then the statute of limitations does not run out until the neighbor’s heirs turn 18 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

2.  A woman adversely possessed property, starting in 2009.  She sells the property to a buyer in 2016.  In 2021, the rightful owner sues for ejectment, claiming that the buyer has not possessed the property for seven years.  Will the suit prevail? 

  

a) yes, because the buyer and the woman were not in privity NO, THERE IS PRIVITY

b) yes, because the buyer was not related to the woman  NO, THERE IS PRIVITY

c) no, because the buyer satisfied the statute of limitations on his own . NO, WE DONT KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG!

d) no, because the woman and the buyer were in privity  YESSSS

  

EVEN WITHOUT PRIVITY OR TACKING, HAS WOMAN MET AP?

  

-BEGINS 2009, SELLS IN 2016 (7 YEARS, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN IN 2009 STARTED AP, NOR DO WE KNOW WHEN IN 2016 SOLD- NO DATES = MAY NOT BE EXACTLY 7 YEARS)

-IS THERE TACKING BETWEEN WOMAN AND BUYER?

  

YES THERE IS PRIVITY AS THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP- BUYER & SELLER

SUIT WILL NOT PREVAIL BECAUSE 12 YRS ADVERSE POSSESSION 

  
  

3.  In 2008, a woman purchases a vacation house in the mountains, where she stays for three weeks a year.  SEASONAL USE In 2021, she discovers that the house’s deed was erroneous, and that in fact it covers nearby land.  She sues for a declaratory judgment that she has obtained title through adverse possession.  In response, the rightful owner argues that the woman’s possession is not continuous.  Which of these facts, if true, best supports the woman’s lawsuit?

  

a) her possession was open, hostile and exclusive MISSING CONTINUOUSNESS

b) after leaving the vacation house, she removed all evidence of her presence WACK

c) the rightful owner also had a vacation house that was used for only a few weeks a year  OWNER ISNT THAT IMPORTANT

d) the typical owner of nearby houses used them for only a few weeks a year CORRECT, SEASONAL OWNERSHIP 

  
  
  

4.  In 2013, a man builds a fence near his house, which overlaps a neighbor’s land by 13 inches.  In 2021, the neighbor sues for ejectment.  The neighbor will prevail if

  

a) he became aware of the overlap in 2013   MEANS POSSESSION IS OPEN BC THERE IS ACTUAL NOTICE- SUPPORTS THE MAN, BUT NOT THE NEIGHBOR (WE ARE LOOKING TO PROVE THERE IS NO AP HERE)

b) the overlap was so small that he could not have known about it (NO CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE, SUPPORTS NEIGHBOR WHO IS TRYING TO SHOW NO AP, SO LOOKS LIKE RIGHT ANSWER) 

c) the neighbor’s tract was so small that the overlap was obvious SHOWS CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE, SUPPORTS AP, SO DOES NOT SUPPORT THE NEIGHBOR

d) the man discovered in 2016 that his fence was on the wrong side of a boundary line SHOWS AP KNEW HE WAS AN ISSUE

  
  
  

5.  Regarding the fact pattern in question 4: which of these facts, if true, would best support a claim that the overlap was hostile? 

  

a) the man discovered in 2016 that his fence was on the wrong side of the boundary line  NOT RELEVANT TO HOSTILITY

b) the neighbor allowed the man to build the fence SHOWS PERMISSION NOT HOSTILE

c) the man made an honest mistake, and did not know that the fence was on the wrong side of the boundary line  STATE OF MIND NOT RELEVANT

d) the neighbor did not give the man permission to build the fence

SIDES V MCDONALD

Feb 10,1958 [rehearing denied march 10, 1958]

  

1.  DEEDS - DELIVERY -PRESUMPTION BURDEN OF PROOF WHERE INSTRUMENT IS FOUND AMONG GRANTORS EFFECTS ON HIS DEATH. - The presumption of nondelivery of a deed, arising from the finding of its among the grantors effects on his death is rebuttable by proof of delivery 
    
2.  DEEDS- DELIVERY WHERE FOUND AMONG GRANTORS EFFECTS ON HIS DEATH-WEIGHT AND SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE- Chancellors finding that deed in question was actually delivered to appellees by there uncle and subsequently returned to him merely for safe keeping held not contrary to a preponderance of the evidence.
    

  

Appeal from Green Chancery Court; W. Leon Smith. Chancellor; affirmed

Rhine Rhine and John C. Watkins for appellant.

  
  
  
  

GIFTS CAN BE MADE DURING LIFETIME OR AFTER DEATH IN A WILL

  

FOR LIFETIME GIFT TO BE VALID THERE MUST BE INTENT, DELIVERY, AND ACCEPTANCE OF GIFT

  

No matter who holds deed, if evidence shows it was meant to be given away w intent then it was delivered

  
  

GIFTS

  

1. Handing over the object makes vivid and concrete to the donor the significance of the act performed. By feeling the “wrench of delivery,” the donor realizes an irrevocable gift has been made.

2. The act is unequivocal evidence of a gift to the actual witnesses of the transaction.

3. Delivery of the object to the donee gives the donee, after the act, prima facie evidence in favor of the alleged gift. [Philip Mechem, Gifts of Chattels and of Choses in Action Evidenced by Commercial Instruments, 21 Ill. L. Rev. 341, 348-349 (1926).]

Constructive delivery is handing over a key or some object that will open up access to the subject matter of the gift. 

  

Symbolic delivery is handing over something symbolic of the property given. The usual case of symbolic delivery involves handing over a written instrument declaring a gift of the subject matter; for example, Joe hands to Marilyn a paper reading, “I give my grand piano to Marilyn. s/ Joe.” 

  

The traditional rule of gifts is: If an object can be handed over, it must be. But there are indications that the rule is eroding. For example, one court found valid constructive delivery where a donor who had received a check from another endorsed the check in blank and put it on a table in her apartment, which she shared with the donee, along with a note giving the check to the donee, and then left with the intention of committing suicide (which she did). 

  
  
  
  

Newman v Bost

A gift of “all the personal property in the house” is not effectively delivered by handing over the keys to the rooms of the house.

Facts

Joseph Van Pelt died intestate with no children. In the final weeks of his life, bedridden, Van Pelt summoned Julia Newman (plaintiff), his housekeeper of ten years, to his bedside. Van Pelt handed Newman a set of keys and proclaimed that he wanted her to have everything in his house. One of the keys on the set was to a locked bureau, which contained a life-insurance policy worth $3,000. Van Pelt's house also contained other items of furniture and property, including property in Newman's personal bedroom. Van Pelt's home had once contained a piano in the parlor. Van Pelt referred to the piano as "Miss Julia's piano." Van Pelt had insured the piano and collected the insurance proceeds on the piano when it burned; he had also indicated that he planned to buy Newman another piano, but he never did. Upon Van Pelt’s death, F.W. Bost (defendant), the administrator of Van Pelt’s estate, took possession of everything in the house on behalf of the estate. Specifically, Bost collected the $3,000 life-insurance payout and the $300 insurance payout for the piano, he sold most of the personal property in the house, and he sold some personal property located in Newman’s room. Newman sued, claiming that the property belonged to her as a gift from Van Pelt and that Bost had inappropriately taken the property. A jury found for Newman. Bost appealed.

Issue

Is a gift of “all the personal property in the house” effectively delivered by handing over the keys to the rooms of the house?

Holding and Reasoning (Furches, J.)

No. A gift of “all the personal property in the house” is not effectively delivered by handing over the keys to the rooms of the house. In order to legally effectuate the giving of a gift, physical delivery of the item is required if appropriate. 

  
  
  
  

Gruen v Gruen

  

Victor Gruen sent a series of letters to his son, Michael (plaintiff), indicating his intention to give Michael a valuable painting for his 21st birthday. Victor did not deliver the painting but kept it in his multiple residences. The painting was to be given to Michael upon Victor’s death, with Victor holding a life estate in the painting. Michael acknowledged the gift to his friends and associates and held both letters for over 17 years to verify the gift after his father's death. Upon Victor’s death, Victor’s wife and Michael’s stepmother, Ms. Gruen (defendant), refused to give Michael the painting. Michael then brought this action. The special term court determined that by retaining a life estate in the painting, Victor invalidated the gift. Michael appealed. The Appellate Division found that a gift is valid even if a life estate is retained in the gift. Ms. Gruen petitioned for certiorari to the Court of Appeals of New York.

TESTAMENTARY- not an immediate gift but one that should add formalities of the will. 

Issue

To make a valid inter vivos gift, must the donor intend to make a present transfer, must either actual or constructive delivery of the gift occur, and must the donee accept the gift?

Holding: court rejects stepmothers reasoning, she responds remainder interest should not be in chattel. Argues that chattel should have been delivered.

Chattel- tangible property that is not land

GIFT NEEDS 

INTENT - CLEAR INTENT TO MAKE A GIFT, INTEREST DAD INTENDED TO CREATE IS VALID

DELIVERY - PHYSICAL DELIVERY NOT REQUIRED FOR REMAINDER , LIFE GIFT AND REMAINDERS CONTRADICT

ACCEPTANCE - 

Reasoning (Simons, J.)

Yes. To make a valid inter vivos gift, (1) the donor must intend to make a present transfer, (2) either actual or constructive delivery of the gift must occur, and (3) the donee must accept the gift.

SLC CORAM, LLC v 543 MIDDLE COUNTRY (2018)

Coram-appellant 543- respondent

  

Facts: Oct 1 2012 Coram became the title owner of 541 property. Adjacent is the 543 property. Jan 7th 2014 survey shows 543 property encroached onto 542 property with paving , fence installation and a shed. President of the middle country asserts pavement and fence were already on property when he came into title in 1985. President then admits he was aware of encroachment in 1990- no action had been taken until 2014.

  

Procedure: 2014 plaintiff desires to recover real property and damages for trespass 

Defendant claims adverse repossession plaintiff moves for summary judgement on cause of action to recover real property and dismiss defendants counter

Defendant then cross moves for summary judgement - supreme court denies plaintiff motion, claiming it to be time-barred. Court denies defendant's motion w/leave to renew upon a proof of the metes and bounds. Plaintiff appeals on denial of motion

  

Claim of right: reasonable basis for belief of ownership

  

To defeat claim of right, actual knowledge by possessor as to who true owner was insufficient, overt knowledge during statutory period 

-   Becomes adverse possessor
    

NY LAW requires claim of right (on part of the adverse possessor) as well as meet adverse possession qualifications (10 year period in NY)

  

RAM v DANN

PLaintiff said full 10 yr possession to land

*adverse possession not founded on a written instrument (i.e. color of title)

  

Color of title- AP based on mistaken deed. Believed rightful ownership over something in writing. Color of title must be held by the adverse possessor.

*If no color of title, AP must prove land was being cultivated or improved substantially (or fencing to make it exclusive)

FEIST PUBLICATIONS, INC. v. RURAL TELEPHONE SERVICE CO.

Facts: Rural Telephone Service Company is a certified public utility that provides telephone service to several communities in northwest Kansas. It is subject to a state regulation that requires all telephone companies operating in Kansas to issue annually an updated telephone directory. Accordingly, as a condition of its monopoly franchise, Rural publishes a typical telephone directory, consisting of white pages and yellow pages. The white pages list in alphabetical order the names of Rural’s subscribers, together with their towns and telephone numbers. The yellow pages list Rural’s business subscribers alphabetically by category and feature classified advertisement of various sizes. Rural distributes its directory free of charge to its subscribers, but earns revenue by selling yellow pages advertisements.

Feist Publications, Inc., is a publishing company that specializes in areawide telephone directories. Unlike a typical directory, which covers only a particular calling area, Feist’s areawide directories cover a much larger geographical range, reducing the need to call directory assistance or consult multiple directories. The Feist directory that is the subject of this litigation covers 11 different telephone service areas in 15 counties and contains 46,878 white pages listings — compared to Rural’s approximately 7,700 listings. Like Rural’s directory, Feist’s is distributed 

p. 142

free of charge and includes both white pages and yellow pages. Feist and Rural compete vigorously for yellow pages advertising.

As the sole provider of telephone service in its service area, Rural obtains subscriber information quite easily. Persons desiring telephone service must apply to Rural and provide their names and addresses; Rural then assigns them a telephone number. Feist is not a telephone company, let alone one with monopoly status, and therefore lacks independent access to any subscriber information. To obtain white pages listings for its areawide directory, Feist approached each of the 11 telephone companies operating in northwest Kansas and offered to pay for the right to use its white pages listings.

Of the 11 telephone companies, only Rural refused to license its listings to Feist. Rural’s refusal created a problem for Feist, as omitting these listings would have left a gaping hole in its areawide directory, rendering it less attractive to potential yellow pages advertisers. In a decision subsequent to that which we review here, the District Court determined that this was precisely the reason Rural refused to license its listings. The refusal was motivated by an unlawful purpose “to extend its monopoly in telephone service to a monopoly in yellow pages advertising.” Rural Telephone Service Co. v. Feist Publications, Inc., 737 F. Supp. 610, 622 (Kan. 1990).

Unable to license Rural’s white pages listings, Feist used them without Rural’s consent. Feist began by removing several thousand listings that fell outside the geographic range of its areawide directory, then hired personnel to investigate the 4,935 that remained. These employees verified the data reported by Rural and sought to obtain additional information. As a result, a typical Feist listing includes the individual’s street address; most of Rural’s listings do not. Notwithstanding these additions, however, 1,309 of the 46,878 listings in Feist’s 1983 directory were identical to listings in Rural’s 1982-1983 white pages. Four of these were fictitious listings that Rural had inserted into its directory to detect copying.

Procedure: Rural sued for copyright infringement in the District Court for the District of Kansas, taking the position that Feist, in compiling its own directory, could not use the information contained in Rural’s white pages. . . . The District Court granted summary judgment to Rural. . . . [T]he Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed “for substantially the reasons given by the district court.” We granted certiorari to determine whether the copyright in Rural’s directory protects the names, towns, and telephone numbers copied by Feist.

Issue: This case concerns the interaction of two wellestablished propositions. The first is that facts are not copyrightable; the other, that compilations of facts generally are. Each of these propositions possesses an impeccable pedigree. . . 

Holding : The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.

Rationale: We conclude that the names, towns, and telephone numbers copied by Feist were not original to Rural and therefore were not protected by the copyright in Rural’s combined white and yellow pages directory. As a constitutional matter, copyright protects only those constituent elements of a work that possess more than a de minimis quantum of creativity. Rural’s white pages, limited to basic subscriber information and arranged alphabetically, fall short of the mark. As a statutory matter, 17 U.S.C. §101 does not afford protection from copying to a collection of facts that are selected, coordinated, and arranged in a way that utterly lacks originality. Given that some works must fail, we cannot imagine a more likely candidate. Indeed, were we to hold that Rural’s white pages pass muster, it is hard to believe that any collection of facts could fail. . . . 

Walker v Time Life Films

Walker must PROVE substantial similarities

Title is not an “idea” so it does not count

Copyright protection granted to appellant’s book extends only to its particular expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves

Ex: book and movie both have throwing people off roofs, however that is a common experience in the area, and the scenes are different- expression is unique, idea is similar but not protected by copyright

### AUTHORS GUILD v. GOOGLE, INC.

United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 2015

Facts: Leval, J. This copyright dispute tests the boundaries of fair use. Plaintiffs, who are authors of published books under copyright, sued Google, Inc. (“Google”) for copyright infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They appeal from the grant of summary judgment in Google’s favor. Through its Library Project and its Google Books project, acting without permission of rights holders, Google has made digital copies of tens of millions of books, including Plaintiffs’, that were submitted to it for that purpose by major libraries. Google has scanned the digital copies and established a publicly available search function. An Internet user can use this function to search without charge to determine whether the book contains a specified word or term and also see “snippets” of text containing the searched-for terms. . . . These activities of Google are alleged to constitute infringement of Plaintiffs’ copyrights. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages.

Google defended on the ground that its actions constitute “fair use,” which, under 17 U.S.C. § 107, is “not an infringement.” The district court agreed. Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google Inc., 954 F. Supp. 2d 282, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). Plaintiffs brought this appeal.

Plaintiffs contend the district court’s ruling was flawed. . . . They argue [that] Google’s digital copying of entire books, allowing users through the snippet function to read portions, is not a “transformative use” within the meaning of Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 578-585 (1994), and provides a substitute for Plaintiffs’ works; [and that] notwithstanding that Google provides public access to the search and snippet functions without charge and without advertising, its ultimate commercial profit motivation and its derivation of revenue from its dominance of the world-wide Internet search market to which the books project contributes, preclude a finding of fair use. . . . We reject these arguments and conclude that the district court correctly sustained Google’s fair use defense.

Purpose of copyright is to protect monetary interest

“Purpose + character” or secondary use- key factor is whether defendants new work is transformative

Transformative: communicates something new & different from original, expands on utility, contributing to copyright overall objective- “public knowledge”

Hathitrust:

Work 1- whole book

Work 2- word search in book (few words here & there)

(tells reader how often word is used)

*Google books is transformative property

Meaning:

Meaning 1- meaning of book 1

Meaning of google books- identifying book 1 is of interest

*a translation is not transformative, does not alter substance

Google books transformatie because taking a snippet has different meanings

Market harm- not a substitution for a book, may even promote it. No harm 

Feb 9 2022

Copyright pt 2

creative/original protected by copyright, facts are not

Test- substantial similarity

Faire use- (balancing test) not all factor have to be in favor

1.  Purpose & character of a defendants use, if defendant is transformative more likely to be faire use
    
2.  Parody transformative if different enough from original
    
3.  Just because its a parody does not mean transformative
    
4.  If plaintiff work is more factual than fiction it is more likely to be fair use
    
5.  Use of unreasonable amount of plaintiffs work is not fair use
    
6.  Economic harm for plaintiff- if plaintiff can prove economic harm, likely will not qualify for fair use
    

“Opt out” option for authors

Suntrust Bank v Mifflin Co.

Derivative work- imitation “substantially similar” 

Vs before 1909- had to directly lift language/direct copy

Parody says it is a critique on the times, diff point of view

Gone w the wind about the slave owners

Still characters are the same

Fair use- wind done gone not a comedy- does that make it a parody? Yes, it comments on the first work

Plaintiff says they state the plot- court says substantiality is necessity, needed content to create an effective parody

Econ harm- really none (hard to gauge though)

Feb 14 2022

In re cordoba restaurants

“Generic” trademark- general terms, processes

Generic bc churrascos restaurant sells churrasco meats

If it was ex a vegetarian place it would be kinda ironic making it not generic

Descriptive marks must  have a secondary meaning

“.com” makes something distinctive refers to a specific brand

Arbitrary marks descriptive 

Guthrie Healthcare v Contextmedia

Logo similarity- causes customer confusion

Name doesnt matter bc logos sometimes show up without company name

Strength of plaintiffs mark

Arbitrary mark- strong, completely unrelated to product

Suggestive- hints at product (also strong)

Generic-unprotected

Fanciful- very strong

Descriptive- like its ok describes product fairly but cn be registered w/ PTO if there is “secondary meaning” well known enough to be publicly identifiable

Customer sophistication- concerned bc logo helps customers discern between brancs to identify products, associate w quality ,etc

Infringement-

-   Likelihood of confusion
    
-   Strength of plaintiffs mark
    
-   Proximity- do they compete geographically
    
-   Sophistication- mixed up by consumers?
    
-   Bad faith- defense act in bad faith?
    
-   Actual confusion - any evidence?
    
-   Quality- if defense is low quality and soils p’s repuutation

Feb 23 2022

Estates

Designed to make transfer clear

-rise of heritability- land held by possessor as tenant of another

-rise of alienability

-rise of fee simple estate

Words of limitation define estate as a fee simple

Die intestate (without will)

Real property goes to heirs

Fee tail usually treated as FSA

Fee tail- give to you & to your bloodline then disappears when your last descendant dies

Present interests

-fees (potentially infinite)

-life estates (not)

“Fee simple absolute” (FSA)

Normal ownership 

What does it mean? Unless you give up property it is yours (or your heirs) forever! No conditions attached

“To A and to his heirs”

Defeasible fees- fees simple w condition

Law doctrine of waste 

Fee simple determinable (FSD)

Created via explicit condition

Grant fee to someone that automatically returns to grantor when condition happens

Ex- to A as long as A does not build a liquor store

Statute of limitations begins to run as soon as condition is violated

Fee simple to subject to condition subsequent (FSCS)

When condition violated, back to grantor. Retains power to terminate interest but grantors right is optional, not automatic

Key element- discretionary language

EX: to A but if a builds liquor store, grantor has right to retake

Fee simple subject to executory interest (FSEI)

Can be automatic or discretionary

Looks like defeasible fee, but it does not go to the original grantor, but a third person if condition occurs

Grantor must do something to take land otherwise becomes an AP situation!

FSCS- statute of limitations does not run until grantor does something to retake land

FSCS v FSD 

Discretionary v Automatic

Law favors FSCS over FSD

Feb 28 2022

Wood v Board

Nothing suggesting right to retain property

Ambiguous grants are treated as FSA

Alienaton

Rule against restraints on alienation- when u give away stuff u cant prevent grantee from transferring it

Affirmative waste- affirmative injury to property

(exception open mind doctrine- life estate holder cn exploit natural resources but only as prior owners did)

Ameliorative waste- type of waste that makes property more valuable

Permissive waste- letting property decay

Baldrighi v Bergeron

Permissive waste :O 

Restraints of alienation

Disabling

Promissory

Forfeiture

Prohibits of transfer

Remedy for waste- injuncture of damages

Permissive waste- cannot take away life estate

Cannot evict someone over waste

Extraordinary event- no duty to repair 

Apartments are waste as it changes nature and character

Melms v pabst brewing co

Expensive brick dwelling house built in 1864

Conveyed to pabst, surrounded by factories

Pabst wants to tear down home & use land for factory

Court says despite it being waste under unusual circumstances it is okay

Home was isolated and surrounded by factories- became undesirable as a residence

Present estate- takes effect as soon as grant happens (fees, life estates)

Future interests- usually 2nd interest in chain, dont take effect immediately

Future interests held by a grantor

Reversion

1.  Can be express- any future interest in grantor that doesnt follow defeasoble fee “to A for life, then back to grantor” - grantor has reversion
    
2.  Also any gap in possession not mentioned in grant “to A for life” - grantor has reversion as there is no follow up for what happens after A dies
    

“To A for life, then to B and heirs” - fee simple absolute life estate (no reversion)

“To A for life then to B and the heirs of her body” (assume were in a state where a common law fee tail is allowed) reversion after bloodline runs out

“To A for life, then to B and her heirs if B attains the age of 21 before A dies” (if B dies before 21 there is a reversion (if it does not say who receives it then there is a reversion)). 

Poss of reverter

BOE v Greene

Under law eliminate determinable fees

Under rule of particular common laaw while a right of reacquisioton would be rendered void at common law if an attempt was made to sign it

Ny specific- grantee can ask for fee simple absolute 

Future interests held by a grantee

Remainsders- interest in a third party not grantor that ma y become possessory after natural termination of prior estate

Not reversion- not in grantor

Not poss of reveerter- not in grantor

Executory interests- in

Remainder never follows a fee unless fee tail  is still alive

FSA- followed by nothing

Fsd- followed by poss of reverter

Fscs- followed by right of entry

Fsei- followed by executory interest

Easiest possible vested remainder

“A for life then to b”

B has remainsder bc it follows life estates

B gets it automatically when A dies, so vested

Remainders (future interests in grantee, usually follow life estates or contigent remainders)

Vested remainders vs contingent remainders

Easy types of vested remainders- no way for remainder person to completely lose their interest!

1.  Indefeasibly vested remainder- what is it? A remainder that cannot be diluted or terminated
    

How is it created? “ to A for life then to B” B has IVR because no conditions attached, and no risk has to share with anyone, and we know who gets the interest.

2.  Vested remainder subject to open (VSO)- (aka vested subject to partial divestment)
    

What is it? Remainder to a group of people (“class gift” where at leat 1 member of the group is known) thus that one members interest is vested but there might be other people redu ing that members hare

How is it created? “To a for life, then to a’s children”

Until A has a first child, childrens remainder is contingent because we dont know who they are

But once A has child 1, that childs interest is VSO

Vested- no way child loses it all

Subject to open- group could expand so even though child gets something might nott get 100T

If 2 children first get 50 pct

If 5 get 20 pct

Hard vested remainders- vested subject to divestment (VSD) or vested subject to condition subsequent, vested subject to executory interest/limitation 

Contingent remainders

Easy contingent remainders- remainders where heirs not yet born or ascertained, to contingent because you dont know who will get it

EX: “to A for life then to B’s children”- B has no children yet, so you dont know who will be the beneficiaries

“To A for life, then to a’s children who survive A”- you dont yet know which ones will survive

Pg. 321

“To A for life, then to B and heirs”

Is B’s remainder vested- Yessir, classic IVR

“And her heirs” changes nothing- this tracks FSA language its just part of b’s remainder 

[contrast] “to A for life, then to B for life, then to B’s heirs”= heirs have wholly separate interest, which would be contingent remainder

2. “To A for life, then to a’s surviving spouse”

A is unmarried now

So therefore a’s spouse has CR since spouse is unknown 

But once A dies, spouse is unknown

3.  “To A for life, then to B for life, then to C and her heirs”
    

A life estate

B and C both have IVRs

“To A for life, then to a’s children who reach 21” assuming a has a child

Contingent when no one bor

What all of this leaves open- what if someone has a remainder is named but theres a condition attached?

“To A for life then to b if b lives to be 21”

Looks vested because b known

Looks contingent because condition

“To A for life, then to b (gift) if B lives to be 21 (condition)”

No comma between gift and condition so contingent

“To A for life, then to B(gift), but if B fails to survive to be 21(condition), then to grantor”

Gift & condition in separate clauses so B has VCD (vested subject to divestment)

Comma rule- if there’s a comma between gift & condition its vested (subject to divestment) aka vested subject to executory limitation, vested condition subsequent, vested to EI)

No comma between gift and condition = contingent remainder

 Folsom Case

“ to alma folsom for life” life estate

Then to those of my children who care for her, UNASCERTAINED (we dont know if any or which kids are caring for her so we have no need to worry about comma rule!)

But if none of my children care for her, 

To whatever person cares for her

FOLSOM HEIRS- MOSTLY T’S grandchildren

(T= testator, dead person who signs the will)

ROWELL HEIRS-  heirs of lillian who did care for alma

FINISH FOLSOM 326-328, 332-334, 337-349

Executory interests

Future interest in a grantee mmust b either a remainder or an executory interest 

If it follows a life estate an indefeasibly vested remainder or a contingent remainder, its a remainder

If it follows a reversion , a FSEI, or VCD it is an executory interest

“To A for life, then to such of A”s children who survive him, but if none of A’s children survive him, then to B”

(A already has two children A & D)

Kids have contingent remainder (who finna survive?)

3. To my cousin donny if and when he survives his wife”

Doesnt get immediately after t dies, so its not a present itnerest ie not a fee or life estate

Reversion- after t dies but while wife is still alive

Don’s El because Don’s interest follows reversion

March 21 2022

When one person controls property for the benefit of another - a trust

Spendthrift trusts are ok (bottom line)

345-55, 357-60, 373-79, NY RAP Law

Doctrine of worthier title- goes back to O

“To a for life then to as children”- valid even at common law

DWT

“To a for life, then to o’s heirs”- violates the doctrine of worthier title

“To a for life, then to o’s children” does not violate DWT because does not say “heirs”

PRINCIPLE OF RAP

Thou shalt not create interests that vest too far into the future

Doesnt cover interests that are already vested (mostly)

Most vested remainders arent covered, revisionary interests in grantor arent covered

What is covered- contingent remainders

Exec interest

VSO

“To a for life, then to a’s grandchildren”

-assume one grandkid born but could be many more!

-assume unborn gc’s interest violates RAP

-born grandchilds interest is dragged down bc if its void to one member of class it is void as to all. 

Weknow if interest violates RAP moment it is created

In situations where it is 99.999 pct certain interest will vest in time, not good enough

Will it vest within 21 yrs of ANY of the measuring lives?

“All interests vest within 21 yrs of death of X”

When is interest created?

Will- when grantor dies

Lifetime deed- when deed is executed

“To a for life, then to a’s great-great-great-grandchildren alive 21 yrs after a’s death”

Interest vests, if at all, within 21 yrs of a’s death so its valid

What if interst never vests?

What if interest violates rule?

Blue pencil out, rest of grant can go into effect

What if no descendants? Nothing left of gift, reversion to grantor

Same if gift violates RAP

“To mary hale and heirs of her body, then to daughters then living of john and elizabeth lee”

Vesting event- what makes the contingent interest certain (what makes them vest)

Vesting event here is the end of a bloodline- death of the last heir of her body, which could be more than 400 yrs after jees dies)

“Fertile octogenarian problem”- rule assumes 80 yo will have kids

To make it valid:“To mary hale and heirs of her body, then to daughters NOW living of john and elizabeth lee”

We now know who daughters now living are as soon as testator dies so its valid! :)

RAP danger scenario- future inteerests in people “then living”

6f.

O A for life, then to A”s children

And upon death of A and A’s children, to T’s grandchildren 

(dead guy who is giving property by will)

Measuring life- A

"TO A for life, 

then to A's children,

and upon the death of A and A's children,

to B's children"

measuring lives- A, B

interest vests when B dies

because interest vests when B dies its valid

6d. TO A for life, 

then to A's children,

and upon the death of A and A's children,

to B's children then living"

meas lives- still A, B 

vesting event- because gift is limited to B's kids "then living" (i.e. when A"s children die) interest doesn't vest until A's children die 

thus invalid because might vest more than 21 yrs after both A and B die

6e. TO A for life, 

then to A's children,

and upon the death of A and A's children,

to A' s grandchildren"

measuring life- A 

vesting event- when A's children die because until then we dont know who all A's GC (which means could be more than 21 yrs after A dies)

SO INVALID 

6f. O A for life, 

then to A's children,

and upon the death of A and A's children,

to T' s grandchildren" (dead guy who is giving property by will)

measuring life- A , T's children (we know who they are when T dies, unlike we don't know yet who A's children are)

so valid 

remember- measuring lives for will are determined at T's death

1.            Figure out which interests are covered by the rule 

2.           Figure out who are measuring lives (above, A, B because named) 

3.           For each interest figure out when interest vests- that is, it becomes certain who will get it (NOT necc. When they will get it) 

A’s children-interest vests when A dies because that’s when we know who A’s children are 

B’s heirs- even though they get POSSESSION when A’s children die 

We know who they are as soon as B dies 

4.            Will the vesting event be within21  yrs of the end of any of measuring lives? 

A’s children- vests as soon as A dies 

B’s heirs- vests as soon as B dies 

Thus all valid  

Hypothetical 3.  

“For all members of my present property class who are admitted to the bar” 

Measuring lives- O, members of the class  

Vesting event- admissions in bar 

Obviously OK because they are alive when they are admitted in bar

Second hypo in 3- “For the first child of A who is admitted to the bar” 

Measuring lives-  O, A 

When does child’s interest vest? Admitted to the bar 

MUST the admission to the bar happen within 21 yrs of the death of either O or A? Might happen more than 21 yrs later so  

INVALID 

If A is dead, O is still a measuring life. Is A’s child (who hasn’t been admitted to bar) a validating life? 

Apparently not 

Even if A dead. Same result. 

4.  “to A for life, then to A’s first child to reach 25” 

Measuring life- A  

Vesting event- child reaches 25 because till then we don’t know who reaches 25 

Question- will child reach 25 within 21 yrs of A’s death? 

Not necessarily, if child who is under 4 when A dies  

EASY CASE OF INVALIDITY 

Does it matter if A has a 26 yr old child B at the time of the conveyance? 

NO because gift doesn’t vest while A is still alive so what could happen is this: 

B dies before A  

A has another child who is only 2 

That child is first one to both survive A and live to 25  

And obviously that child’s interests more than 21 yrs after both A and B die 

SO INVALID 

5.           “To A for life,  

Then to A’s widow for life, 

Then to A’s issue then living at A’s widow’s death” (issue= children and their descendants) 

A’s widow- vests as soon as A dies, slam dunk valid, not a problem 

A’s issue-  

Who are the measuring lives(relevant lives in being when deed happens)- A, O, but not widow because she might not be born yet (i.e. even if A has a current wife, she might die and be replaced by someone so young she’s not alive at time of gift) 

Vesting event- when A’s widow dies 

Is there any poss that A’s widow might die more than 21 yrs after O and A die? OF COURSE 

THUS GIFT INVALID 

“unborn widow problem” 

Change to “now living”- gift fine because relevant issue lives in being 

How to avoid RAP problems- redraft as To A for life, then to A’s widow, then to A’s children living at the time of A’s death- no more RAP problems because everyone known when A dies 

Vesting event? A dies  

Lucas v Hamm 

6a. “To A for life,  

Then to A’s children for their lives, 

And upon the death of A and A’s children,  

To B if A dies childless.” 

Measuring lives- A, B  

Vesting event? A’s death  

6b. To A for life,  

Then to A’s children for their lives, 

And upon the death of A and A’s children,  

To B if A has no grandchildren then living” 

Measuring lives- T, A, B 

Vesting event- when A’s children die 

Obviously this could happenmore than 21 yrs after T, A and B are deceased 

Therefore slam dunk invalid  

MONDAY: finish 6c-f, rest of RAP reading, then start reviewing old exam questions as promised 

15 (2020 final).  A grantor’s will includes the following provision: “Blackacre to my son, but if he  transfers the land, my estate may reenter and retake the land.”  A decade later, the son wants to sell the land.  Which of these statements about his rights are most accurate?

a) he may transfer the land, but the grantor’s estate may use its right of entry to thwart such a transfer 

b) the son has a fee simple absolute because the restraint on alienation is invalid  

c) because the restraint is a forfeiture restraint rather than a disabling restraint, it is valid 

d) the grantor has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent  

16 (from a bar review book, not one of mine): A landowner owned a tract of land in fee simple.  He conveyed it to a purchaser, “his heirs and assigns: but if my friend A shall be living 30 years from the date of the deed, then to A, his heirs and assigns.”  The limitation “to A his heirs and assigns” is:

a) valid because A’s interest is a reversion

b) valid because the interest will vest, if at all, during a life in being

c) valid because A’s interest is vested subject to divestment

d) invalid

LIFETIME WILL?

TC- YES YES

JT- YES NO

TE/E- NO NO

Quiz #2

1.  If no rap school board has fsei bc potentially infinite & subject to EI bc if they misuse it it does not go back to grantor
    
2.  If no rap issue vinny has EI because it follows FSEI
    
3.  Does vinnys interest violate the rule? 
    
4.  What causes vinnys interest to vest? School BD stops using for school purposes
    
5.  Measuring life- vinny
    
6.  Definitely could vest more than 21 yrs after vinny dies bc school board could change use in 2500 
    
7.  Vinny interest invalid
