Property II
Created: 2022-08-28 17:01

what is property?- a bundle of sticks!
but ong?- "legal relations between persons with respect to a thing"

lease:
-property conveyance & a contract

how can a tennant transfer?
1. assignment- entire term, no reentry
2. sublease- part of term, right to cut short, right to reenter

privity!!!<3 

plaintiff can only sue defendant if they are in privity of contract or estate

of contract- relationship between 2 parties that have entered a contract with eachother

of estate- relationship between 2 parties who have mutual or successive possessory claims in the same property
*novation*- landlord must EXPLICITLY release a tenant 

#### Defaulting Tenant 
*in possession*- [[Berg v. Wiley (1978)]]
*self help*- landlord evicts tenant without going throught courts

common law rule- self help can only be used if:
1. L is legally entitled to possession, AND
2. L's means of reentry are peaceable

modern rule- self help is never permitted 

*abandoned possession*- [[Sommer v. Kridel (1977)]]

mitigation of damages- renting to another tenant to lessen a loss

common law rule- Landlord has no duty to mitigate. Under common law, lease is a transfer of properrty to T so would not make sense for Landlord to intervene

majority rule- landlord has duty to mitigate, must attempt to relet property

surrender- if accepted, relieves tenant liability of future rent (but not accrued/missed rent)
doctrine of anticipatory breach- declares they could not fulfill obligation 



#### Transfers of land

- Real estate contracts are almost always executory, meaning that title is not transferred immediately upon signing the agreement
- mortgage contingency, which provides that if the purchaser cannot obtain a mortgage loan within a given time, she can rescind the contract and get back her deposit
- In many states (New York, for example) the transfer of the deed takes place with all parties physically present; in some other states (California, for example) transfer is handled by a third-party escrow agent.


### Statute of Frauds

- To satisfy the Statute of Frauds a memorandum of sale must, at a minimum, be signed by the party to be bound, describe the real estate, and state the price. 
- When a price has been agreed upon, most courts regard it as an essential term that must be set forth. But if no price was agreed upon, a court may imply an agreement to pay a reasonable price
- Exceptions to the Statute of Frauds. Courts have created two principal exceptions to the Statute of Frauds: part performance and estoppel. 
	- *Part performance* allows the specific enforcement of oral agreements when particular acts have been performed by one of the parties to the agreement. Acts held to constitute part performance vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, depending primarily on how the court views the theoretical basis for the doctrine of part performance. 
	- *Estoppel* applies when unconscionable injury would result from denying enforcement of the oral contract after one party has been induced by the other seriously to change his position in reliance on the contract. Estoppel may also apply when unjust enrichment would result if a party who has received the benefits of the other’s performance were allowed to rely upon the Statute. 

E-sign provides that “a signature, contract, or other record . . . may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” 15 U.S.C §7001(a)(1). 

Section 7006(5) defines an electronic signature as “an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.” 15 U.S.C. §7006(5)


pg 574 #3 

*O, owner of Blackacre, executes and delivers a deed of Blackacre to her daughter A as a gift. The deed is not recorded. Subsequently O tells A that she would like Blackacre back, and A, a dutiful daughter, hands the deed back to O and says, “The land is yours again.” O tears up the deed. Who owns Blackacre?*
uhhhhhhhhh LMFAO


*Suppose that, instead of as above, O executes and delivers a deed to her daughter conveying Blackacre to O and A as joint tenants. The deed is not recorded. Subsequently, A tells O she would like her son B to have her interest, and O agrees. To save the recording tax on two deeds, A “whites out” her name on the deed and replaces it with B’s name. This deed is then recorded. O dies. Who owns Blackacre? See Mann v. Mann, 677 So. 2d 62 (Fla. App. 1996)

I- Can harry use self-help?
R- modern rule- self help rule 
A- The landlord must go through the proper legal channels to evict the tenant. 
C- Court should rule in favor of Daryl 

Whats a tenant to do when landlord fails to keep premises in livable condition?

##### convenant of quiet enjoyment (property law)
- a tenants right to be free from serious interference with tenancy and from acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leasehold.
- generally, can be waived
- remedy? damages from landlord
- tenant can cease to pay rent (and not move out) until the problem is solved

##### constructive eviction (property law)
- act or omission of the landlord that renders the premises substantially unsuitable for the purpose for which they were leased, or that seriously interferes with beneficial enjoyment of the premises
- to bring a constructive eviction suit, **T must leave the premises and seek shelter elsewhere within a reasonable time (not true of breach of quiet enjoyment)
- legal result of constructive eviction: T not liable for rent & can get damages 

##### implied warranty of habitability (contract law)
- creates a duty in landlord to keep rental property (typically residential) in good condition
- gives tenant the right to withhold rent and make repairs
- remedy: damages
- courts look to housing codes and standards in other state & local legislation
- a substantial violation of a state, municipal, or city housing code is usually a prima facie case against a landlord but if conditions render premises unsafe or unhealthy, IWH is breached
**not waivable

actual eviction- when the tenant is deprived of the occupancy of some part of the demised premises - tenant physically cannot enter

constructive eviction- act or omission materially deprives tenant of beneficial use or enjoyment of the property, tenant may abandon property & avoid further obligation under the lease

[[Hilder v. St. Peter (1984)]]
- common law: caveat lessee
- under contract law. there is an implied warranty of habitability in all leases (oral or written)
- landlord will deliver over and maintain throughout the period of the tenancy premises that are safe clean and fit for human habitation
- included patent & latent defects
- **cannot be waived**
- tenant can stay in possession and whithold rent (unlike contructive eviction) and seek damages



Issue: Is Rose liable for the $500 of missing rent
R: implied warranty of habitability
a: cannot be waived, conditions must be safe for an individual to continue living there, and landlord did violate city housing code
c: seek damages for extermination & july rent

- if district doesnt recognize warranty of habitablity, claim quiet enjoyment 


9/7/22
best practice is novation should be in writing- has to be explicit (if lease is over a year triggers statute of frauds)
does not necessarily need to be in writing but hey 

##### Fixtures
- a fixture is a chattel that a tenant attaches to real property. fixture then becomes part of the real property.
- tenant can remove the fixture before or soon after the end of the lease term if : 
1. the tenant does not inent to attach it permanently; and
2. removal of the fixture will not substantially damage the real property or the fixture

**a trade fixture** is a fixture that  tenant installs for use in their trade or business

tenant can remove the fixture before or soon after the end of the lease term if removal of the fixture will not substantially damage the real property or the trade fixture. 


#### Timeline of real property purchase/sale
searching for a home
negotiating a contract
executing a contract
executory period
closing
post closing


*check privity of contract, sublease & assignment designates liability*

implied warranty of habitability- can be used as a defense if landlord brings an action against T for unpaid rent

#### real estate 
(man fuck real estate)
regulations 

land transaction- buying & selling a home
- purchase & sale contract
- exectuory period: attorney review
	- title contingency
	- mortgage contingency
	- inspection contingency
	- appraisal contingency
buyer is reviewing documents/negotiating
- closing- transfer
-deed executed
money paid
possession and title transfers to buyers

every real estate contract there is an express and implied covenant

##### title insurance & recording system
every state has a recording system
do you need to record a transfer for it to be valid? -nah

real estate brokers-
whose agents are they?

possible scenarios:
- no broker
- prospective buyer uses sellers broker- to whom does broke owe a fiduciary duty? seller- not buyer
- prospective buyer uses a buyers broker- to whom does broker owe duty? buyer

### statute of frauds- 
must have a writing for sale of real property
- requirements: 
	- must have a writing for sale of real property
	- signed by the party to be bound
	- description of property
	- price (or mechanism to determine price)

9/14/22

### common law exceptions to statute of frauds-
1. evidentiary theory- need satisfactory evidence that there was a contract
2. theory of equity- detrimental reliance, one party is harmed that the law is meant to protect

#### part performance-
- allows for specific enforcement of oral agreement when certain actions have been performed under the contract (generally need 2 out of 3)
	- substantial improvement
	- deposit/earnest money
	- buyer goes into possession
- plus the action taken is "unequivocally referable to contract for sale"

specific enforcement- must give property

#### estoppel-
- applies when unconscionable injury would result from denying enforcement of the oral contract after one party has been induced by the other to change his position in reliance on the contract OR whe needed to avoid unjust enrichment
- unlike part performance, could involve activities that might not relate to performing the contract

A orally agrees to sell land to B, then A tries to back out.
B can get specific enforcement if
1. B, in reasonable reliance on the contract and continuing the assent of A,
2. "has so changed his position that injustice can be avoided by specific enforcement"

restatement- treatise/collection of the law

[[HICKEY v. GREEN (1983)]]

key fact is green does not deny existence of oral agreement w hickey- evidence refers to 


walker v ireton
- buyer claims to have sold his farm in reliance on deal, though he didnt tell seller
- -as far as items in writing, there is an uncashed deposit check
- signed by the party to be bound? description of property? price? - does it satisfy statute of frauds? -
- 

covenant to convey marketable title is implied in every real estate sale contract unless it is xpress or waived


MARKETABLE TITLE- free from reasonable doubt, does not expose party to unreasonable risk of litigation

seller must convey marketable title at the time of closing
this means that if there is a defect in title, the seller ha the abiity to cure the defect up to the time of closing

covenant of marketable title is implied regardless of the type of deed the seller promises to give. this emans that the seller must deliver marketable title even if the seller promises to five the buyer a quitclaim deedd, a general warranty deed, or a special warranty deed-
remedy?:
buyer can request recission 

can buyer sue the seller for breach of the covenant to convey marketable title after the closing? -no

note: if the seller had given the buyer a warranty deed, buyer would still lose bc he sued the contract and not the deed

defects that make title unmarketable
seller does not own title she prmises to convey
example: seller promises to convey a few simple absolute but owns a life estate
- seller claims title based ona adverpse possesiion but did not sue to quiet title
- prop subeject to encumbrances, recordeered easements or convenants that have not been waived mortgage sor tax liens that have not been waived, options to purchase that haave not been waived
- violations of a zoning ordinantnce not the existence of a zoning ordinance does not make title unmarketable
- -acts by seller or predecessor including permanent encorachmenet s yjat could be expected to result in litiation 
- ex- seller builds an addition that extends onto the neighbors property 

- undisclosed liens, mortgages, or other fiancial encumbrances = no marketable title 
- undiscolsed easements generally render title unmarketable. exceptio: if easment is obvious, marketability varies by state

ex: title search reveals that  a prior owner covenanted that no industrial uses could be conducted on property- marketable title?
no there is not, undisclosed

### Equitable Conversion
- traditional majority rule: buyer bears risk of loss (from flood, fire, other damage) even if seller is in possession
- minority: loss on seller until closing, loss on party in possession. Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Act. (rule in NY)

s contracts to sell farm to B
s devises all his real estate to a and his personal prop to c

under prevailing doctrine, who gets s' interest in the farm?
c, farm is no longer considered real estate. proceeds of sale fo to party getting personal property 



Remedies for Breach of the Sales Contract. 
1. Specific performance
2. damages
3. Rescission and retention of deposit.
4. Liens.

1. **Consideration.** It is customary to state in a deed that some consideration was paid by the grantee, in order to raise a presumption that the grantee is a bona fide purchaser entitled to the protection of the recording acts against prior unrecorded instruments. 
2. **Description of tract.** A deed must contain a description of the parcel of land conveyed that locates the parcel by describing its boundaries.
3. **Seal.** An old saw says a deed to land is effective when it is signed, sealed, and delivered. The requirement of a signed document was initiated by the Statute of Frauds in 1677.
4. **Forgery and fraud.** A forged deed is void. The grantor whose signature is forged to a deed prevails over all persons, including subsequent bona fide purchasers from the grantee who do not know the deed is forged. 
5. **Indenture and deed poll**- The deed was written out twice on a single sheet of parchment and signed at the end of each copy by both grantor and grantee. An indenture is to be contrasted with a deed poll, which is signed only by the grantor. It was called a deed poll because the top was not indented but polled or shaved even.


[[Frimberger v. Anzellotti (1991)]]



[[Rockafellor v. Gray (1922)]]


#### ESTOPPEL BY DEED 
Suppose that a grantor conveys land to a grantee that the grantor does not own, and the grantor warrants the title to the land. 

- If the grantor subsequently acquires title to the land, the grantor is estopped to deny that he had title at the time of the deed and that title passed to the grantee. Since the grantee could sue the grantor on the warranty, when the grantor later acquires title, and compel the delivery of a new conveyance, the law eliminates the necessity of a lawsuit and automatically passes the subsequently acquired title to the grantee.

#### Delivery 
To be effective, a deed must be delivered with the intent that it be presently operative. 

Delivery is rarely an issue in commercial transactions. Either the grantor hands the deed to the grantee upon receipt of the purchase price, or the grantor puts the deed in the hands of a third party (an escrow agent) who hands over the deed upon closing the transaction. In the first case, the grantor intends to make an immediate transfer of title to the grantee. In the second, the grantor intends to transfer title when all conditions are fulfilled. If there is an enforceable contract of sale, the escrow agent is the agent of both the grantor and grantee. The grantor cannot recall the deed from the agent. When the agent delivers the deed to the grantee, if necessary to carry out the parties’ intent and do equity, the title of the grantee will “relate back” to the date the grantor handed the deed to the agent. For example, if the grantor dies before the escrow agent delivers the deed, the delivery of the deed by the agent is treated as if it occurred before the grantor’s death. By this fiction the rule that a will is required to pass title at death is avoided. Title is regarded as having been transferred to the grantee during the grantor’s life.

**_Delivery without handing over_**.

To deliver a deed of land, it is not necessary that the deed be “handed over” to the grantee. **“Delivery” means no more than an act that evinces an intent to be immediately bound by the transfer.** 

The act can be, of course, handing over the document to the grantee, but it can also be the grantor’s declaration, express or implied, that he is bound by his deed. 

If the grantor intends to pass title or a future interest to the grantee _now_, there has been a delivery even though possession may be postponed until the grantor’s death. On the other hand, if the grantor intends that no interest should arise until death, no delivery during life has taken place; the deed cannot take legal effect at death because the grantor intended it to be a will, not a deed, and the instrument is not executed with two witnesses in accordance with the Statute of Wills. 

[[Rosengrant v. Rosengrant (1981)]]

#### Financing, Mortgages and Foreclosure

1. The Byars purchase the house and finance the purchase as stated above. Subsequently, the Byars default on payments of the note secured by the first mortgage and the bank forecloses. At the foreclosure sale, the house brings $100,000. How should this be distributed? What if the sale price at foreclosure was $160,000?

Suppose the Byars had defaulted on payments of the note secured by the second mortgage, but had kept paying the note given to the bank. What would be the rights of the second mortgagee?

2. _Deficiency judgments._ If the house brings $100,000 on foreclosure sale, and the mortgage debt is $140,000, can the mortgagee obtain a deficiency judgment for $40,000 against the borrower? The answer may turn on whether $100,000, the proceeds of sale, is a fair price for the property and hence the appropriate amount to credit against the debt. If foreclosure is through a judicial proceeding, the sale price is ordinarily not challengeable (unless it shocks the conscience of the court), and the amount realized is applied to the debt. The mortgagee is entitled to a deficiency judgment for the difference, collectible out of the general assets of the borrower. When the foreclosure is by private sale, however, courts may scrutinize the sale more closely to assure that the mortgagee acted fairly, and may deny a deficiency judgment when there are sufficient grounds to set the sale aside. Thus if the mortgagee is interested in obtaining a deficiency judgment against the borrower, judicial foreclosure is the prudent route. See Grant S. Nelson & Dale A. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law §8.1 (5th ed. 2007).
