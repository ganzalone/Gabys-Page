Property II
Created: 2022-08-28 17:01

what is property?- a bundle of sticks!
but ong?- "legal relations between persons with respect to a thing"

lease:
-property conveyance & a contract

how can a tennant transfer?
1. assignment- entire term, no reentry
2. sublease- part of term, right to cut short, right to reenter

privity!!!<3 

plaintiff can only sue defendant if they are in privity of contract or estate

of contract- relationship between 2 parties that have entered a contract with eachother

of estate- relationship between 2 parties who have mutual or successive possessory claims in the same property
*novation*- landlord must EXPLICITLY release a tenant 

#### Defaulting Tenant 
*in possession*- [[Berg v. Wiley (1978)]]
*self help*- landlord evicts tenant without going throught courts

common law rule- self help can only be used if:
1. L is legally entitled to possession, AND
2. L's means of reentry are peaceable

modern rule- self help is never permitted 

*abandoned possession*- [[Sommer v. Kridel (1977)]]

mitigation of damages- renting to another tenant to lessen a loss

common law rule- Landlord has no duty to mitigate. Under common law, lease is a transfer of properrty to T so would not make sense for Landlord to intervene

majority rule- landlord has duty to mitigate, must attempt to relet property

surrender- if accepted, relieves tenant liability of future rent (but not accrued/missed rent)
doctrine of anticipatory breach- declares they could not fulfill obligation 



#### Transfers of land

- Real estate contracts are almost always executory, meaning that title is not transferred immediately upon signing the agreement
- mortgage contingency, which provides that if the purchaser cannot obtain a mortgage loan within a given time, she can rescind the contract and get back her deposit
- In many states (New York, for example) the transfer of the deed takes place with all parties physically present; in some other states (California, for example) transfer is handled by a third-party escrow agent.


### Statute of Frauds

- To satisfy the Statute of Frauds a memorandum of sale must, at a minimum, be signed by the party to be bound, describe the real estate, and state the price. 
- When a price has been agreed upon, most courts regard it as an essential term that must be set forth. But if no price was agreed upon, a court may imply an agreement to pay a reasonable price
- Exceptions to the Statute of Frauds. Courts have created two principal exceptions to the Statute of Frauds: part performance and estoppel. 
	- *Part performance* allows the specific enforcement of oral agreements when particular acts have been performed by one of the parties to the agreement. Acts held to constitute part performance vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, depending primarily on how the court views the theoretical basis for the doctrine of part performance. 
	- *Estoppel* applies when unconscionable injury would result from denying enforcement of the oral contract after one party has been induced by the other seriously to change his position in reliance on the contract. Estoppel may also apply when unjust enrichment would result if a party who has received the benefits of the other’s performance were allowed to rely upon the Statute. 

E-sign provides that “a signature, contract, or other record . . . may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” 15 U.S.C §7001(a)(1). 

Section 7006(5) defines an electronic signature as “an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.” 15 U.S.C. §7006(5)


pg 574 #3 

*O, owner of Blackacre, executes and delivers a deed of Blackacre to her daughter A as a gift. The deed is not recorded. Subsequently O tells A that she would like Blackacre back, and A, a dutiful daughter, hands the deed back to O and says, “The land is yours again.” O tears up the deed. Who owns Blackacre?*
uhhhhhhhhh LMFAO


*Suppose that, instead of as above, O executes and delivers a deed to her daughter conveying Blackacre to O and A as joint tenants. The deed is not recorded. Subsequently, A tells O she would like her son B to have her interest, and O agrees. To save the recording tax on two deeds, A “whites out” her name on the deed and replaces it with B’s name. This deed is then recorded. O dies. Who owns Blackacre? See Mann v. Mann, 677 So. 2d 62 (Fla. App. 1996)

I- Can harry use self-help?
R- modern rule- self help rule 
A- The landlord must go through the proper legal channels to evict the tenant. 
C- Court should rule in favor of Daryl 

Whats a tenant to do when landlord fails to keep premises in livable condition?

##### convenant of quiet enjoyment (property law)
- a tenants right to be free from serious interference with tenancy and from acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leasehold.
- generally, can be waived
- remedy? damages from landlord
- tenant can cease to pay rent (and not move out) until the problem is solved

##### constructive eviction (property law)
- act or omission of the landlord that renders the premises substantially unsuitable for the purpose for which they were leased, or that seriously interferes with beneficial enjoyment of the premises
- to bring a constructive eviction suit, **T must leave the premises and seek shelter elsewhere within a reasonable time (not true of breach of quiet enjoyment)
- legal result of constructive eviction: T not liable for rent & can get damages 

##### implied warranty of habitability (contract law)
- creates a duty in landlord to keep rental property (typically residential) in good condition
- gives tenant the right to withhold rent and make repairs
- remedy: damages
- courts look to housing codes and standards in other state & local legislation
- a substantial violation of a state, municipal, or city housing code is usually a prima facie case against a landlord but if conditions render premises unsafe or unhealthy, IWH is breached
**not waivable

actual eviction- when the tenant is deprived of the occupancy of some part of the demised premises - tenant physically cannot enter

constructive eviction- act or omission materially deprives tenant of beneficial use or enjoyment of the property, tenant may abandon property & avoid further obligation under the lease

[[Hilder v. St. Peter (1984)]]
- common law: caveat lessee
- under contract law. there is an implied warranty of habitability in all leases (oral or written)
- landlord will deliver over and maintain throughout the period of the tenancy premises that are safe clean and fit for human habitation
- included patent & latent defects
- **cannot be waived**
- tenant can stay in possession and whithold rent (unlike contructive eviction) and seek damages



Issue: Is Rose liable for the $500 of missing rent
R: implied warranty of habitability
a: cannot be waived, conditions must be safe for an individual to continue living there, and landlord did violate city housing code
c: seek damages for extermination & july rent

- if district doesnt recognize warranty of habitablity, claim quiet enjoyment 


9/7/22
best practice is novation should be in writing- has to be explicit (if lease is over a year triggers statute of frauds)
does not necessarily need to be in writing but hey 

##### Fixtures
- a fixture is a chattel that a tenant attaches to real property. fixture then becomes part of the real property.
- tenant can remove the fixture before or soon after the end of the lease term if : 
1. the tenant does not inent to attach it permanently; and
2. removal of the fixture will not substantially damage the real property or the fixture

**a trade fixture** is a fixture that  tenant installs for use in their trade or business

tenant can remove the fixture before or soon after the end of the lease term if removal of the fixture will not substantially damage the real property or the trade fixture. 


#### Timeline of real property purchase/sale
searching for a home
negotiating a contract
executing a contract
executory period
closing
post closing


*check privity of contract, sublease & assignment designates liability*

implied warranty of habitability- can be used as a defense if landlord brings an action against T for unpaid rent


9/12/22

#### real estate 
(man fuck real estate)
regulations 

land transaction- buying & selling a home
- purchase & sale contract
- exectuory period: attorney review
	- title contingency
	- mortgage contingency
	- inspection contingency
	- appraisal contingency
buyer is reviewing documents/negotiating
- closing- transfer
-deed executed
money paid
possession and title transfers to buyers

every real estate contract there is an express and implied covenant

##### title insurance & recording system
every state has a recording system
do you need to record a transfer for it to be valid? -nah

real estate brokers-
whose agents are they?

possible scenarios:
- no broker
- prospective buyer uses sellers broker- to whom does broke owe a fiduciary duty? seller- not buyer
- prospective buyer uses a buyers broker- to whom does broker owe duty? buyer

### statute of frauds- 
must have a writing for sale of real property
- requirements: 
	- must have a writing for sale of real property
	- signed by the party to be bound
	- description of property
	- price (or mechanism to determine price)

9/14/22

### common law exceptions to statute of frauds-
1. evidentiary theory- need satisfactory evidence that there was a contract
2. theory of equity- detrimental reliance, one party is harmed that the law is meant to protect

#### part performance-
- allows for specific enforcement of oral agreement when certain actions have been performed under the contract (generally need 2 out of 3)
	- substantial improvement
	- deposit/earnest money
	- buyer goes into possession
- plus the action taken is "unequivocally referable to contract for sale"

specific enforcement- must give property

#### estoppel-
- applies when unconscionable injury would result from denying enforcement of the oral contract after one party has been induced by the other to change his position in reliance on the contract OR whe needed to avoid unjust enrichment
- unlike part performance, could involve activities that might not relate to performing the contract

A orally agrees to sell land to B, then A tries to back out.
B can get specific enforcement if
1. B, in reasonable reliance on the contract and continuing the assent of A,
2. "has so changed his position that injustice can be avoided by specific enforcement"

restatement- treatise/collection of the law

[[HICKEY v. GREEN (1983)]]

key fact is green does not deny existence of oral agreement w hickey- evidence refers to 


walker v ireton
- buyer claims to have sold his farm in reliance on deal, though he didnt tell seller
- -as far as items in writing, there is an uncashed deposit check
- signed by the party to be bound? description of property? price? - does it satisfy statute of frauds? -
- 

covenant to convey marketable title is implied in every real estate sale contract unless it is xpress or waived


MARKETABLE TITLE- free from reasonable doubt, does not expose party to unreasonable risk of litigation

seller must convey marketable title at the time of closing
this means that if there is a defect in title, the seller ha the abiity to cure the defect up to the time of closing

covenant of marketable title is implied regardless of the type of deed the seller promises to give. this emans that the seller must deliver marketable title even if the seller promises to five the buyer a quitclaim deedd, a general warranty deed, or a special warranty deed-
remedy?:
buyer can request recission 

can buyer sue the seller for breach of the covenant to convey marketable title after the closing? -no

note: if the seller had given the buyer a warranty deed, buyer would still lose bc he sued the contract and not the deed

defects that make title unmarketable
seller does not own title she prmises to convey
example: seller promises to convey a few simple absolute but owns a life estate
- seller claims title based ona adverpse possesiion but did not sue to quiet title
- prop subeject to encumbrances, recordeered easements or convenants that have not been waived mortgage sor tax liens that have not been waived, options to purchase that haave not been waived
- violations of a zoning ordinantnce not the existence of a zoning ordinance does not make title unmarketable
- -acts by seller or predecessor including permanent encorachmenet s yjat could be expected to result in litiation 
- ex- seller builds an addition that extends onto the neighbors property 

- undisclosed liens, mortgages, or other fiancial encumbrances = no marketable title 
- undiscolsed easements generally render title unmarketable. exceptio: if easment is obvious, marketability varies by state

ex: title search reveals that  a prior owner covenanted that no industrial uses could be conducted on property- marketable title?
no there is not, undisclosed

### Equitable Conversion
- traditional majority rule: buyer bears risk of loss (from flood, fire, other damage) even if seller is in possession
- minority: loss on seller until closing, loss on party in possession. Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Act. (rule in NY)

s contracts to sell farm to B
s devises all his real estate to a and his personal prop to c

under prevailing doctrine, who gets s' interest in the farm?
c, farm is no longer considered real estate. proceeds of sale fo to party getting personal property 



Remedies for Breach of the Sales Contract. 
1. Specific performance
2. damages
3. Rescission and retention of deposit.
4. Liens.

1. **Consideration.** It is customary to state in a deed that some consideration was paid by the grantee, in order to raise a presumption that the grantee is a bona fide purchaser entitled to the protection of the recording acts against prior unrecorded instruments. 
2. **Description of tract.** A deed must contain a description of the parcel of land conveyed that locates the parcel by describing its boundaries.
3. **Seal.** An old saw says a deed to land is effective when it is signed, sealed, and delivered. The requirement of a signed document was initiated by the Statute of Frauds in 1677.
4. **Forgery and fraud.** A forged deed is void. The grantor whose signature is forged to a deed prevails over all persons, including subsequent bona fide purchasers from the grantee who do not know the deed is forged. 
5. **Indenture and deed poll**- The deed was written out twice on a single sheet of parchment and signed at the end of each copy by both grantor and grantee. An indenture is to be contrasted with a deed poll, which is signed only by the grantor. It was called a deed poll because the top was not indented but polled or shaved even.


[[Frimberger v. Anzellotti (1991)]]



[[Rockafellor v. Gray (1922)]]


#### ESTOPPEL BY DEED 
Suppose that a grantor conveys land to a grantee that the grantor does not own, and the grantor warrants the title to the land. 

- If the grantor subsequently acquires title to the land, the grantor is estopped to deny that he had title at the time of the deed and that title passed to the grantee. Since the grantee could sue the grantor on the warranty, when the grantor later acquires title, and compel the delivery of a new conveyance, the law eliminates the necessity of a lawsuit and automatically passes the subsequently acquired title to the grantee.

#### Delivery 
To be effective, a deed must be delivered with the intent that it be presently operative. 

Delivery is rarely an issue in commercial transactions. Either the grantor hands the deed to the grantee upon receipt of the purchase price, or the grantor puts the deed in the hands of a third party (an escrow agent) who hands over the deed upon closing the transaction. In the first case, the grantor intends to make an immediate transfer of title to the grantee. In the second, the grantor intends to transfer title when all conditions are fulfilled. If there is an enforceable contract of sale, the escrow agent is the agent of both the grantor and grantee. The grantor cannot recall the deed from the agent. When the agent delivers the deed to the grantee, if necessary to carry out the parties’ intent and do equity, the title of the grantee will “relate back” to the date the grantor handed the deed to the agent. For example, if the grantor dies before the escrow agent delivers the deed, the delivery of the deed by the agent is treated as if it occurred before the grantor’s death. By this fiction the rule that a will is required to pass title at death is avoided. Title is regarded as having been transferred to the grantee during the grantor’s life.

**_Delivery without handing over_**.

To deliver a deed of land, it is not necessary that the deed be “handed over” to the grantee. **“Delivery” means no more than an act that evinces an intent to be immediately bound by the transfer.** 

The act can be, of course, handing over the document to the grantee, but it can also be the grantor’s declaration, express or implied, that he is bound by his deed. 

If the grantor intends to pass title or a future interest to the grantee _now_, there has been a delivery even though possession may be postponed until the grantor’s death. On the other hand, if the grantor intends that no interest should arise until death, no delivery during life has taken place; the deed cannot take legal effect at death because the grantor intended it to be a will, not a deed, and the instrument is not executed with two witnesses in accordance with the Statute of Wills. 

[[Rosengrant v. Rosengrant (1981)]]

#### Financing, Mortgages and Foreclosure

1. The Byars purchase the house and finance the purchase as stated above. Subsequently, the Byars default on payments of the note secured by the first mortgage and the bank forecloses. At the foreclosure sale, the house brings $100,000. How should this be distributed? What if the sale price at foreclosure was $160,000?

Suppose the Byars had defaulted on payments of the note secured by the second mortgage, but had kept paying the note given to the bank. What would be the rights of the second mortgagee?

2. _Deficiency judgments._ If the house brings $100,000 on foreclosure sale, and the mortgage debt is $140,000, can the mortgagee obtain a deficiency judgment for $40,000 against the borrower? The answer may turn on whether $100,000, the proceeds of sale, is a fair price for the property and hence the appropriate amount to credit against the debt. If foreclosure is through a judicial proceeding, the sale price is ordinarily not challengeable (unless it shocks the conscience of the court), and the amount realized is applied to the debt. The mortgagee is entitled to a deficiency judgment for the difference, collectible out of the general assets of the borrower. When the foreclosure is by private sale, however, courts may scrutinize the sale more closely to assure that the mortgagee acted fairly, and may deny a deficiency judgment when there are sufficient grounds to set the sale aside. Thus if the mortgagee is interested in obtaining a deficiency judgment against the borrower, judicial foreclosure is the prudent route. See Grant S. Nelson & Dale A. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law §8.1 (5th ed. 2007).

- ADVERSE POSSESSION & STATUTE OF FRAUDS
	- through adverse possession, one obtains title 

covenant to convey marketable title implied in every real estate  contract unless it is expressed or waived

marketable title is title free from reasonable doubt and does not expose the party holding it to an unreasonable risk of litigation.
seller must convey marketable title at the titme of the closing.
this means if there is a defect in title, seller has the ability to cure the defect up  to the time of closing.

covenant of marketable title is implied regardless of the type of deed the seller promises to give, means the seller must deliver marketable title even if the seller promises to give the buyer a quitclaim deed, a geneeral warranty deed, or a special warranty deed.

remedy? if the seller cannot convey marketable title, the buyer can seek recission of the contract or damages. 

rule- "bright line rule" 
vs standard

duty to disclose defects

Stambovsky v. Ackley
ny follows caveat emptor (minority rule)- buyer beware, generally absent fraud, misrepresentation or fiduciary relationship. 
- holding **equity**

Johnson v Davis

false representation- fraud
disclose latent material defects 
if (1) s knows of defects (2) that materially affects value and (3) is not readily observable or known to buyer

majority rule- seller of residential property must disclose all known material defects

duties to disclose stigma

implied waarranty of quality (or habitability)
- recognized in most jurisdictions
- applies to residential property
- applies to new construction of all or part of a house
- apples to a commercial seller or builder who is a "merchant of housing"
- applies to latent material defects in construction
- claim arises after the closing 
- in a majority of states, claim may be brought by a subsequent purchaser (though some states continue to require privity between the seller and buyer)

remedies for breach of real estate sales contract

The Implied Warranty of Quality (or Habitabilty) 
Recognized in most jurisdictions
Applies to residential property
Applies to new construction of all or part of a house 
Applies to commercial seller or builder who is a “merchant of housing” 
Applies to latent material defects in construction 
Claim arises after the closing
In a majority of states, claim may be brought by a subsequent purchaser (though some states continue to require privity between the seller and buyer) 

Remedies for breach of Real Estate Sales Contract
Specific Performance:
 Both buyer and seller can obtain specific performance of a real estate sale contract because of the uniqueness of land and the doctrine of mutuality of remedies 
Damages: 
Majority Rule for breach by buyer or seller: Difference between the contract price and the fair market price at the time of the breach
Minority Rule: Difference between the contract price and the fair market price at the time of resale of property 
Breach by seller caused by inability to convey marketable title: 
Jurisdictions are divided between…


## MARKETABILITY
English Rule (Flureau): 
If the seller, believing title was good, acted in good faith, the buyers recovery is limited to the deposit and incidental damages

American Rule (growing trend): 
the buyer can recover expectation damages (see majority rule above) and reasonably foreseeable special damages

Seller and buyer execute a valid K for the sale and purchase of Lawacre. The agreed purchase price is $500,000, which also represented the fair market value at that time. Prior to closing, the buyer informs the seller of his decision to move elsewhere. The prevailing market price is 400,000. Despite the seller's best efforts, she can only sell Lawacre nine months after the buyer's breach for 325,000. 
What damages can the seller obtain? 
Majority rule: Seller can recover $100,000, the difference between the K price and the fair market price at the time of breach. 
Minority rule: (which is the rule for the sale of goods): the seller could obtain $175,000

Majority rule absent a liquidated damages clause: If the buyer breaches, the seller may rescind and retain the deposit generally up to 10% of the purchase price
Minority rule absent a liquidated damages clause: If the buyer breaches, the seller may rescind ad retain the deposit up to the damages suffered by the seller
With a liquidated damages clause: If the K specifies the amount of damages in case of breach (liquidated damages), the provision is generally valid as long as the amount is not disproportionate to the actual damages 

The Deed: 
Elements
In writing 
Stating: 
Names of grantor and grantee
Language granting a property interest (“give” or “transfer”) 
Description of land that provides location and boundaries
Signature of grantor (SOF) (a forged deed is invalid)
Grantee must accept the deed (generally presumed) 
Grantor must have a present intent to transfer the property, and under the majority rule, the grantor cannot retain a power to revoke
Delivery of the deed provides evidence of intent to make a present transfer
An acknowledgment is necessary to record the deed but a deed as between the grantor and grantee is valid without an acknowledgement or recording
A deed does not require consideration
Deed protection, examples
Ex 1: S sells property to B1. B1 takes out 20k mortgage on the property, then sells to B2 without paying off the mortgage. 
What types of deeds would protect B2 from the mortgage holders interest? 
General warranty or special warranty (given that B1 cause the defect in title) 

Ex 2: S sells property with an existing 20k mortgage to B1. B1 sells to B2. 
What type of deed would protect B2? 
General warranty only, because the seller (B1) didnt cause the defect
Deed: Present Covenants
Warranties regarding state of title at the time of transfer are breached, if at all, when title is transferred
Statute of limitations starts to run when deed is delivered
Damages= difference in price between price at time of conveyance and what its worth now


Types of deeds
General Warranty Deed: warrants title against all defects in title, whether they arose before or after the grantor took title 
Provides the most protection to the buyers
Seller covenants with the buyer that not only has …
QuitClaim Deed: contains no warranties (or covenants of title) of any kind, merely conveys whatever title that grantor has, if any. Grantee cannot sue the grantor 
“As is” is generally a quitclaim deed
Seller has duty to disclose latent defects, but seller has no other responsibilities 
Special Warranty Deed: Contains warranties only against the grantors own acts but not the acts of others. Ex grantors predecessors executed (defect in mortgage), grantor is not liable 
Seller covenants with the buyer that the seller has not Personally done anything to adversely affect the title being conveyed


present covenants
warranties regardng state of title at the time o


future covenants
- warranties regarding potnetial future problems w the property
- can only be breached after closing and transfer of property
- statute of limitations does not beigin to run until the date tjay tje covenant is breached

covenant of general warranty- grantor warrants no lawful outstanding claim against the property exists
quiet enjoyment- grantor warrants grantee wont be ousted from the property by someone claiming superior title
futher assurances- rantor priises to xecute other documents required to perfect the title conveyed

PAST CLOSING
-if there is a problem w title, u can sue under covenants 



FRIMBERGER v. ANZELLOTTI

court uses broad languageb to hold that concept of encumbrances cannot be expanded to include latent violations


a remote granteee is a person who was granted by a party of the chain 


ROCKAFELLOR v. GRAY 604

does a remote grantee have a cause of action- 
illustration of how remote gratnor /implied warranties play out




ROSENGRANT v. ROSENGRANT

MURPHY v. FIN. DEV. CORP.

U.S. BANK NATL. ASSN. v. IBANEZ



assignment vs sublease
alll interest vs not all interest
priv of estate vs no privity of estate
						last tenant NOT liable to L

interest: right to possess 

privity = bridge

privity of contract vs privity of estate

not a TRUE assignment unless it is for the whole interest

defaulting tenant- 
modern rule: landlord cannot use self help- JUDICIAL REMEDIES
common law: landlord can only use self help if there is legal right to possession, and it is peaceful. 

duty to mitigate- landlord cannot allow backrent to accumulate
[[Sommer v. Kridel (1977)]] *does not apply in every state, but applies in NY*

common law rule- Landlord has no duty to mitigate. Under common law, lease is a transfer of properrty to T so would not make sense for Landlord to intervene

majority rule- landlord has duty to mitigate, must attempt to relet property

active seeking of new tenant- must show efforts are being made

covenant of quiet enjoyment- (prop law defense) T can withold rent & leave the premises. duty of landlords to provide suitable environment. waived when renter is aware of the conditions when moving in. can stay & not pay rent until problem is solved
requirements to use  defense- reasonable notice to landlord addressing issue, landlord must be neglectful and not be working to correct the issue. 

constructive eviction- substantially unsuitable for the purpose it was leased, renter must leave! requirements 
	1. conditon of leased premises amounts to quiet enjoyment 
	2. there must be notice of tenant leaving
	3. breach must be substantial to justify tenant leaving, 
	4. tenant must leave in a reasonable amt of time.

implied warranty of habitability: residential only
CANNOT BE WAIVED, even if a lease says otherwise. 
breach occurs when a defect adversley impacts health or safety in the eyes of a reasonable person. 
- building code violations or ordinances are not conclusive, compelling but not perf.

in case where landlord is prox caause of the , courts wil find he has in fact breached the warrant 

fixtures:
affixed to property
permanently 
if u take it away, decreases the propertys value

removal- tenant can remove before or soon after lease term IF it is not intended to be permanently detached, and removal would not substantially dcrease value of property
no intent to remain,

trade fixtures- installled for tenants trade or business- common for commercial business
tenant can remove if it will not substantially remove
INTENTION TO REMAIN DOES NOT MATTER
if residential, tenant liable for affirmative waste

tenant has duty to not commit waste-
ammeliorative waste- may increase value of property, bbut characteristic of the property is fundamentally altered

tenant duty to make minor repairs- according to common law
tenant has duty to change lightuilb, to clean filter in dryer, fill in holes he created

minor repair- anything that does not require special certification
if repair will likely not lead to further damage if not done by professional

maintaining the property to restore/original condition
forseeability is not enough


###### Statute of frauds
at a minimum, signed collection memo, assigned writings signature by party to be bound 
reasonable description of land- lot & plot #, rooms 
must state consideration in writing- how much is paid, downpayment etc

- partially integrated- disagreement ab cost, courts will determine fair cost of house
- partial performance- specific enforcement of oral agreement when aprticular acts have been performed by one of the parties of the agreement
1. buyer takes possession of land OR
2. buyer pays all or part of price of land OR
3. buyer makes substantial improvements to the land

in addition, to qualifying 2/3
need at least one exception:
1. action is unequivocally referable to the contract of sale (evidence must exist that it is in relation to the land contract)
2. equitable estoppel- when unconscionable injury would occur due to carrying out of the contract

implied covenants of land contract- CAN ONLY BE CLAIMED IN CONTRACT PERIOD

implied covenant to convey marketable title- before closing date, contract period, if owner risks litigation, title not marketable

defect must be undisclosed and unknown to buyer

implied promise from seller to not commit misrepresenatation- seller has duty to disclose all defects that will decrease value of home
if within sellers knowledge, or reasonable person is unlikely to discover 

buyer has duty to investigate thoroughly !!!
sellers can refuse to disclose in ny but seller must give $500 credit

as is contracts are typically upheld if defects are easily discoverable

liens stay w the house no matter what

implied warranty of quality
only residential

re ipsum loquitor ((torts chill tf out))

equitable conversion- 
majority- buyer bears risk of loss
minority- seller bears risk of loss - NY rule (until closing)

what happens if not mentioned in sales contract? 

remedies for breach of sale
-specific performance
- damages- the difference between contract price & fair market price at time of the breach

damages granted by the lower court- esitmation of fair market value 

mortgage substitutes
- 
Sebastian v Flord (1979)

every state requires that records on property are kept in each county 
recording is not required, but it protects you against competing claims against a subsequent bona fide purchaser (someone who in good faith gave consideration purchase for value of property)


COMMON LAW- FIRST PARTY TO PURCHASE PROPERTY IS TH EOWNER
DEFAULT RULE WHEN RECORDING ACTS DO NOT APPLY

race recording acts- 

notice- protects sub purch who does not have notice of prior deed against prior unrecorded instruments, even if subsequent purchaser fails to racord
can be actual notice or constructive notice by virtue of recording

## recording acts
to protect bona fide purchasers

SHELTER RULE-
person who takes property fron grantor that is a BFP for value & has superuior rights udnet the recording act has same rights a shis or her grantor
grantors superior rights over another person temrinate any rights that the other person may have had
shelter rules applies in notice jurisdictions


mortage is a security interest in land that serves as colateral for the repayment of a loan
(mortage deed/note)

writing required- 

mortgager/borrower/land owner/debtor

mortgagee/creditor

parties rights

lien theory- (majority)
debtor has title and write to possession absent foreclosure
mortgagee has a lien conferring right to take action on ownership of land if debtor defaults on loan 

title theory- (minority)
mortgagee has title to property during loan term, not borrower

unless instructed otherwise, lien theory applies

equitable mortgage- 
debtor gives creditor a deed to his land as collateral for his debt instead of executing mortgage

acceleration clauses
terms in loan agreements that require mortgager to pay off full loan if full conditions are met (ex, mortgager misses too many payments)

transfer
mortgager sells property, mortgage remains on the land
ie grantee takes subject to the mortgage

mortgager remains liable to mortgagee for the loan

assumption- grantee promises to pay existing mortgage loan 
grantee becomes primarily responsible to mortgagee, oroginal party now secondarily responsible

can transfer by
1. endorsing mortgage note & delivering to trasnferee
2. executing separate assignment of mortgage interest 

holder in due course
takes mortgage note free of any personal defenses that oculd have been raised against original mortgagee (contractual issues)

still remains subject to real defenses (fraud, durress)

negotiable note- must be made payable to the named mortgagee

endorsed- note must be signed by named mortgagee. 

delivered- note must be delivered to the tranfferee AND good faith & value paid

transferee must take note in good faith (w/o notice of illegality)

forseclosure/mortgage rights to property
foreclosure-
upon default, mortgagee can foreclose via judicial action

-prop sold to satisfy in whole/in part
-deficiency judgement- if debt exceeds sale proceeds, mortgagee can file suit against mortgager for debt balance. 
-if proceeds exceed debt balance, jr liens paid in order of priority 
-redemption in equity- at any time prior to foreclosure sale, mortgager can redeem property by paying amount due
-statutory right of redemption- some jurisdictions allow mortgager for a certain period to buy back period after foreclosure sale. 
-mortgagee possession- mortgagee right to possession prior to foreclosure depends on jurisdiction. 

lien theory- no right to possess prior to foreclosure
title theory- right to possess at any time upon demand. mortgagee can always take possession w mortgagers consent/abandonment. mortgagee in possession assumes risk in accounting for rent, managing property & tort liability

foreclosures & multiple creditors/interests
priority of creditors- creditors must record interests
recorded interests take priority in order redcorded

purchase money mortgages is superior to all interests
PMM = mortgage given in exchange for funds given for property

PMM given to either seller as part of purchase price or to third party lender if both sellers PMM is senior to third party lender. Creditors can agree to subordinate priority to a junior creditor. 

JUNIOR interests- terminated by foreclosure of a superior claim IE upon foreclosure junior interest holders cannot look to the land to satisfy debts
- can seek deficiency judgement against debtor, but have no interest in the subject property. 
necessary parties- junior interests are necessary parties & must be included in a senior foreclosure action. otherwise, junior interest will remain on the land. 

senior interests- unaffected by junior interest foreclosures, buyer of foreclosed properrty takes it subject to senior interests. buyer is not liable for senior debt but the senior mortgage remains on the land. 

O-A (no record ) meaning no constructive notice
A-B (record)- wild deed as it is outside the chain of title
O- C (records)

race- first to record, no good faith required

notice- no notice of prior instrument, dont have to record

race-notice- records first, no notice of prior instrument (u need both)

common law- first in time first to purchase gets it.

donee has same rights as grantor (as long as grantor is a BFP)





Easement
A non-possessory interest in someone  
else’s property for a particular  
purpose.  
➢An easement is an agreement allowing  
a non-owner to enter upon and use a  
piece of property for a particular  
purpose.  
➢It does not convey title to property.

Creation of Easements  
•By Express Grant (Written Instrument)  
•By Estoppel  
•By Implication  
•Easement Implied by Prior Existing Use  
•Easement Implied by Necessity  
•By Prescription

➢Scope of easement is based on intent of parties that established the easement

Easement in gross v. easement appurtenant  

Easement in gross:An easement that is not created to benefit any landowner with respect to a particular tract of land. It belongs to the holders regardless of whether they own any adjacent property.  
E.g., Public utilities often hold easements in gross through residential property.  
➢The benefit of such an easement is personal to its holder.  
Easement appurtenant: An easement that attaches to or benefits a particular tract of land.  
Such an easement runs with the land.  
➢If X has easement appurtenant across Y’s property, and X sells to Z, Z now has easement across Y’s property.

Notice statute model:  
"Every conveyance, transfer or mortgage of real property, or of any interest  
therein, is invalid against subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration and  
without notice, unless the same be recorded according to the law.”  
Race-Notice statute model:  
“Every conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser or  
mortgagee of the same property, or any part thereof, in good faith and for a  
valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded, and as against  
any judgment affecting the title, unless the conveyance shall have been duly  
recorded prior to the record of notice of action.”

A nuisance, but is there liability?  
If person intentionally substantially invades someone’s enjoyment of property with  
unreasonable conduct, (or if person unintentionally invades and her conduct is negligent, reckless or  
ultrahazardous).  
• When is a nuisance intentional?  
When the person whose conduct is in question as a basis for liability knows or should know  
that the impact on others is substantially certain to result from his conduct.

Unreasonableness (in Intentional Nuisance)  
Restatement (Second) of Torts:  
A person is liable for nuisance if they intentionally invade someone’s enjoyment of property  
with unreasonable conduct.  
• Court considers whether the gravity of the harm outweighs the utility of the actor’s  
conduct. (See factors on pp. 734-35.)  
Jost approach:  
Looks at whether interference crosses threshold marking a point of liability.  
• E.g., Are people being made ill or not? Avoids subjective balancing.  
Alternative Restatement (Second) Test:  
“[T]he harm caused by the conduct is serious and the financial burden of compensating for  
this and similar harm would not make the continuation of the conduct not feasible.”  
• The idea is: make the party causing the nuisance pay off the tort victim.  
➢ Recall, tests for unreasonableness only apply to intentional nuisance.

Nuisance—Lateral and Subadjacent Support  
A property owner has the right to lateral and subadjacent support from another property owner  
Lateral Support:  
Support from an adjacent or neighboring property (i.e., the support is given on the side of the  
property).  
E.g., A owns Alphacre and B owns Betacre. B digs a ditch adjacent to Alphacre in preparation for  
building a pool. Alphacre caves in as a result because it no longer has support along a common  
border. Can A sue B for B’s failure to provide A with lateral support?  
Subjacent support:  
Support given by property from below the surface.  
The issue of subjacent support arises when one property owner owns the surface rights, and  
another property owner owns the subsurface rights.  
E.g., assume that C owns the surface rights to Gammacre and D owns the subsurface  
rights. There are large deposits of natural gas underneath Gammacre's surface. When D  
extracted the gas, the surface of Gammacre caved in or subsided.

Nuisance—Lateral and Subadjacent Support Common Law Rules  
If the land is in its natural state, the excavator is strictly liable to the owner for  
damage to the land due to the removal of lateral or subjacent support.  
➢ Thus, in the examples on previous slide, B and D would be strictly liable to A  
and C, respectively if Alphacre and Gammacre were in a natural state and not  
developed.  
If the land is developed with structures, the excavator is liable in negligence if the  
excavator gives notice to the adjacent or surface owner.  
➢ A negligence standard reflects the recognition that an owner who erects a  
structure on his or her property may have contributed to the property  
damage.

NuisanceRemedies for non-trespassory invasions of property rights.  
Protects use or enjoyment of one’s own property.  
:  
A private nuisance exists where one makes an improper use of his own property and in ways that injures the land or some incorporeal right of one’s neighbor.


Mortgage: a security interest in real property to secure a loan to the mortgagor from the mortgagee.  
▪The mortgagor is the borrower or an assignee of the borrower and the mortgagee is the lender or the successor to the lender.  
▪The loan is evidenced by a note that creates personal liability in the borrower.  
Foreclosure: a sale under judicial supervision or a non-judicial sale in which the property of the debtor, who does not pay the debt evidenced by the note, is sold and the proceeds of the sale are used to pay the outstanding debt.  
Deed of trust: (recognized in most jurisdictions) frequently treated as a mortgage.  
The borrower transfers title to another person, as Trustee, to secure payment of the debt. In the event of the borrower’s default, the Trustee has the power to sell the property in a non-judicial sale, which must accord with procedural safeguards similar to those in a foreclosure—includes notice and a public sale.  
Equity of redemption: mortgagor’s (borrower’s) interest in the property


•Race Recording Act:  
Between successive purchasers, first to record wins, regardless  
of notice.  
E.g., O conveys to A who doesn’t record.  
O conveys to B, who knows about deed to A (i.e., has notice).  
B records deed.  
Who prevails?  
B would prevail.  
➢This is rare.

Recording Acts—to protect bona fide purchasers: Notice Acts  
•Notice: Protects subsequent purchaser who does not have notice of prior deed against prior unrecorded instruments, even if subsequent purchaser fails to record.  
E.g., O conveys to A who doesn’t record. O conveys to B who does not know about deed to A. B does not record.  
Who wins?  
•B would prevail.  
➢In half of the states.  
➢Can be actual notice or constructive notice by virtue of recording or inquiry notice.  
E.g., O sells Blackacre to A. A records. 5 years later, O sells Blackacre to B.Who wins?  
A wins; B would lose, because B has constructive notice by virtue of A recording. A is now protected.

Recording Acts—to protect bona fide purchasers: Race-Notice Acts  
•Race-Notice (NY): Protects subsequent purchaser against prior unrecorded instruments only if subsequent purchaser  
1. does not have notice of prior instrument AND 2. records first.  
E.g., O sells Blackacre to A. A records. 5 years later, O sells Blackacre to B. Who prevails?  
A wins, B loses. B has constructive notice by virtue of A recording.  
➢Note: If A records after B buys Blackacre, then B records, who prevails?  
A prevails over B.

Recording Acts—protect bona fide purchasers (as opposed to donees)  
•Bona Fide Purchaser (aka bona fide purchaser for value without notice):  
An innocent party who purchases property without notice of any other party’s claim to the title of that property.  
➢Outside of the two states that have race statutes, BFP’s have the strongest claim to property.  
How does the law generally treat people who have received land as a gift (donees)?  
➢Not as well!  
E.g., O sells Atlantis to A. A does not record. Later, O gives Atlantis to B. B records. Statutes protect purchasers. B cannot meet requirements for protections.  
➢Common Law governs—A owns.  
E.g., O sells to A, then O devises same property to B.  
➢Common Law governs—A owns.

Example of Shelter Rule  
O → Woman, donee, does not record.  
O → Neighbor, purchaser without notice, recorded.  
Then, Woman records.  
Neighbor had no notice because woman recorded after the neighbor’s purchase.  
Neighbor → Son, donee, recorded.  
If this is a jurisdiction with a race-notice statute (includes “who shall first record”),  
party who is a BFP who has no notice of prior interest and records first prevails.  
Neighbor purchased property and had no notice of Woman’s deed and recorded  
before Woman.  
➢Neighbor (purchaser) prevails over woman and shelters son.

Shelter Rule (see 684 n.9)  
Under the shelter rule, a person who takes property from a grantor,  
who is a bona fide purchaser for value and has superior rights under  
the recording act, has the same rights as his or her grantor.  
The grantor’s superior rights over another person terminate any rights that  
the other person may have had.  
▪In the preceding example, the Woman was the first grantee.  
Because she did not record prior to the Neighbor’s purchase of  
Greenacre and the Neighbor recorded first, the Neighbor prevails  
under the race-notice statute and terminates the Woman’s rights  
against any of the Neighbor’s successors.  
This is true even if the Neighbor’s grantee is a donee.  
➢The shelter rule also applies in notice jurisdictions.

n a notice jurisdiction: Woman v. Friend Who wins?  
➢Friend wins  
Neighbor is subsequent purchaser for value who took without notice of Woman’s claim.  
Neighbor shelters Friend  
Under the shelter rule, BFP’s (the Neighbor’s) grantee will prevail against any interest that  
the grantee’s predecessor (Neighbor) would have prevailed against.  
➢This is true even when the grantee (Friend) had knowledge of the prior interest  
(Woman’s interest).

Subject to the Mortgage and Assumption of the Mortgage  
•If the mortgagor transfers his property and the mortgage is not paid off, the  
transferee takes the property subject to the mortgage.  
If the transferee defaults, the mortgagee can foreclose, and the proceeds will  
pay off all or part of the remaining loan.  
•The mortgagee cannot sue the transferee for a deficiency because the transferee  
is not personally liable.  
•The mortgagee can sue the mortgagor for the deficiency because the mortgagor  
remains personally liable on the note absent a novation.  
•If the transferee assumes the mortgage, the transferee becomes personally and  
primarily liable for the debt.  
The mortgagor is secondarily liable on the note absent a novation.

Morse (majority): A prior deed from an owner (O to A) recorded after a later deed from the same owner (O to B) does not give constructive notice of the prior deed (O to A) to subsequent purchasers (C) from the grantee of the second deed (B).  
Once C finds the O to B deed in the grantor index, C does not have to continue searching. C prevails.  
Woods (minority): Opposite view. The prior deed does give constructive notice. C must search until the closing. A prevails.
