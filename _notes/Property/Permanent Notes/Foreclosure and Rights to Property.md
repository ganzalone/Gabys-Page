## Foreclosure
upon default mortgagee can satisfy debt through foreclosure by judicial action
- property is sold to satisfy the debt in whole or in part
- *deficiency judgement*- if the debt exceeds sale proceeds, mortgagee can file suit against mortgagor for debt balance
- if proceeds exceed debt balance, junior liens are paid in order of priority

## Redemption in Equity
- at any time prior to foreclosure sale, mortgagor can redeem property by paying the amount due
- *statutory right of redemption*- some jurisdiction allows mortgagor for a certain period to buy the property back after foreclosure sale

## mortgagee posession
- mortgagees right to posession prior to foreclosure depends on jurisdiction
- lien theory- no right to posess prior to foreclosure
- title theory- right to posess at any time upon demand
- mortgagee can always take posession with mortgagor's consent or abandonment
- mortgagee in posession assumes the risk of accounting for rent, managing property, and tort liability
