A mortgage is a security interest in land that serves as collateral for the repayment of a loan 

- writing required, to fulfill SOF
- mortgagor = debtor/borrower/land owner
- mortgagee = creditor

## Parties' Rights

### The Lien theory (majority)
- Mortgagor has title and right to posession absent foreclosure
- Mortgagee has a lien conferring a right to take action for ownership of the land if the mortgagor defaults on loan

### Title theory (minority)
- mortgagee has title to property during loan term, not mortgagor/borrower

*unless instructed otherwise, assume lien theory applies

### Equitable Mortgage 
- Debtor gives creditor a deed to his land as collateral for the debt instead of executing a mortgage. 

### Acceleration Clauses
- Terms in loan agreements that require mortgagor to pay off full loan immediately if certain conditions are met. Ex: too many payments missing.
