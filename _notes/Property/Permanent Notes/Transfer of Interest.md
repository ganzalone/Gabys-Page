### Mortgagor transfer
where mortgagor sells property, mortgage remains on the land (i.e. grantee takes subject to mortgage)

- mortgagor remains liable to mortgagee for the loan 
- assumption- the grantee promises to pay existing mortgage loan
- grantee becomes primarily liable to mortgagee; original party is secondarily liable as surety 

### Mortgagee (creditor) transfer
- mortgagee can transfer interest by:
	- endorsing mortgage note and delivering it to transferee
	- executing a separate assignment of the mortgage interest 

### holder in due course- 
a holder in due course lender takes a mortgage note free of any personal defenses the mortgagor could have raised against original mortgagee
- he still remains subject to real defenses (duress, fraud, etc.)

2. indorsed- note must be signed by the named mortgagee
3. delivered- note must be delivered to the transferee
