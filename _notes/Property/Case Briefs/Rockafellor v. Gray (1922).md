## Rule of Law

The covenant of seisin is a promise of title that runs with the land such that a remote grantee may bring an action under it.

## Facts

Rockafellor (plaintiff) received a piece of land that was encumbered by a mortgage to Gray (defendant). Rockafellor agreed to assume this mortgage. 

Four years later, the property went through foreclosure, and Connelly acquired a sheriff’s deed to the property. Connelly conveyed the land to Dixon for $4,000; the conveyance deed contained the usual covenants of warranty. Two months later, Dixon conveyed the property to Hansen & Gregerson by special warranty deed for $7,000. 

## Procedure
After these transfers, Rockafellor sued Gray to have the sheriff’s sale vacated for lack of jurisdiction. Hansen & Gregerson filed a cross-petition asking that if the foreclosure sale were vacated, Connelly be found liable to them for damages stemming from Connelly’s faulty deed as conveyed to Dixon. The trial court found in favor of Rockafellor and vacated the foreclosure sale. With respect to the cross-petition, the court held that the covenant of seisin ran with the land and awarded Hansen & Gregerson $4,000 (the consideration paid by Dixon) plus interest starting from the date of the conveyance from Dixon to Hansen & Gregerson. Connelly appealed.

## Issue

Is the covenant of seisin a promise of title that runs with the land such that a remote grantee may bring an action under it?

## Holding and Reasoning (Faville, J.)

Yes. **The covenant of seisin is a promise of title that runs with the land such that a remote grantee may bring an action under it. A covenant of seisin runs with the land, but it is broken when a conveyance is delivered and becomes instead a chose in action – a right to sue the original grantor to enforce property rights – based on the original covenant.**

This right accrues regardless of whether a remote grantee takes actual possession of the land, and it may pass from one remote grantee to the next.

- Here, Connelly did not in fact have title to the land at the time he sold it to Dixon, and Dixon likewise had no title when he in turn assigned the property to Hansen & Gregerson. Each of them acquired a right of action for breach of the covenant of seisin; this right passed from Connelly through Dixon to Hansen & Gregerson. 

- The fact that neither Connelly nor Dixon ever took possession of the land is immaterial. 
- With respect to the amount of damages, remote grantees may not recover any more than the grantor who first took the defective covenant of seisin.

- Thus, although Hansen & Gregerson paid Dixon more for the deed than Dixon paid to Connelly, Hansen & Gregerson are not permitted to recover more than Dixon could have recovered. Hansen & Gregerson is entitled to $4,000 plus interest in damages. The district court’s decree is affirmed.
