## Rule of Law

Under Indiana law, a tenant who has been wrongfully evicted may abandon the premises and stop paying rent, even if the exclusive-remedy provision provides that the tenant may not terminate the lease or withhold rent if the landlord breached.

## Facts

The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office (MCPO) (defendant) leased the basement of a building from Village Commons, LLC and Rynalco, Inc. (Landlord) (plaintiffs) for an office and evidence storage space. The seven-year lease began in August 1999. The lease provided that the Landlord would maintain the premises, but limited the remedies available to the MCPO in case of a breach to the right to sue for an injunction or damages. The MCPO had no right to terminate the lease or withhold rent. 

The property began having water leaks in 2001. Repeated leaks caused substantial damage to the premises. Further, the water issues damaged boxes of evidence. The Landlord instructed the MCPO to move evidence out of problem areas. Though the Landlord made repairs, it failed to fix the problem. The Landlord declined to pay for mold remediation, despite possible health risks. The MCPO vacated the building in January 2003 and stopped paying rent. The Landlord sued for breach. The MCPO counterclaimed for wrongful eviction. 

## Procedure: 

The trial court held that the exclusive-remedy provisions in the Lease did not preempt the MCPO’s defenses and that the Landlord had actually and constructively evicted the MCPO. The court awarded the MCPO damages, and the Landlord appealed to the Court of Appeals of Indiana.

*plaintiffs were ACTUALLY evicted, and then later constructively evicted*

## Issue

May a tenant who has been wrongfully evicted abandon the premises and stop paying rent if the lease contained an exclusive-remedy provision providing that the tenant was not entitled to terminate the lease or withhold rent if the landlord breached?

## Holding and Reasoning (Riley, J.)

Yes. A landlord’s wrongful eviction relieves the tenant of the obligation to pay rent. Indiana law recognizes the application of contract law principles to leases. Courts interpreting leases must ensure that the entire document is given meaning. Indiana courts have upheld exclusive-remedy provisions in leases out of respect for the freedom of contract. The question is whether such a provision eliminates the tenant’s right to stop paying rent after a wrongful eviction. Actual eviction occurs “when the tenant is deprived of the occupancy of some part of the…premises.” Constructive eviction occurs when the tenant “is deprived of the beneficial enjoyment” of part of the premises. A tenant who is actually or constructively evicted may leave and avoid her lease obligations or stay and sue for trespass. In short, when a landlord impairs the tenants right to actually occupy the entire property, the tenant will no longer be obligated to pay rent. Similarly, if the landlord abrogates the tenant’s right to beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises, the tenant may leave the property within a reasonable time and stop paying rent. Here, the lease limits the remedies available to the MCPO in the event of the Landlord’s breach to suing for an injunction and damages. The provision is effective, and the MCPO had no right to terminate the lease or withhold rent. However, the exclusive-remedy provision only limits the MCPO’s ability to terminate. The Landlord evicted the MCPO, and it is the Landlord’s acts that alleviated the MCPO’s duty to pay rent. The evidence supports the trial court’s finding that the Landlord’s failure to remedy the recurring water leaks deprived the MCPO of the ability to occupy and use a portion of the property. The ruling of the trial court is affirmed.
