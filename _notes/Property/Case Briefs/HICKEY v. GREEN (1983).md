Plaintiff(s):
Defendant(s):

### Procedural history:
 The Hickeys filed this complaint seeking specific performance. Mrs. Green asserts that relief is barred by the Statute of Frauds contained in G.L. c. 259 §1. The trial judge granted specific performance. Mrs. Green has appealed. 

### Facts:
- Mrs. Gladys Green owns a lot (Lot S) in the Manomet section of Plymouth. In July, 1980, she advertised it for sale. 
- On July 11 and 12, Hickey and his wife discussed with Mrs. Green purchasing Lot S and “orally agreed to a sale” for $15,000. 
- Mrs. Green on July 12 accepted a deposit check of $500, marked by Hickey on the back, “Deposit on Lot . . . Massasoit Ave. Manomet . . . Subject to Variance from Town of Plymouth.” Mrs. Green’s brother and agent “was under the impression that a zoning variance was needed and [had] advised . . . Hickey to write” the quoted language on the deposit check. 
- It turned out, however, by July 16 that no variance would be required. Hickey had left the payee line of the deposit check blank, because of uncertainty whether Mrs. Green or her brother was to receive the check, and asked “Mrs. Green to fill in the appropriate name.” Mrs. Green held the check, did not fill in the payee’s name, and neither cashed nor endorsed it.
- Hickey “stated to Mrs. Green that his intention was to sell his home and build on Mrs. Green’s lot.” “Relying upon the arrangements . . . with Mrs. Green,” the Hickeys advertised their house on Sachem Road in newspapers on three days in July, 1980, and agreed with a purchaser for its sale and took from him a deposit check for $500 which they deposited in their own account. 
- On July 24, Mrs. Green told Hickey that she “no longer intended to sell her property to him” but had decided to sell to another for $16,000. Hickey told Mrs. Green that he had already sold his house and offered her $16,000 for Lot S. Mrs. Green refused this offer. 

### Rule of law:
Restatement (Second) of Contracts, §129 (1981). The section reads, A contract for the transfer of an interest in land may be specifically enforced notwithstanding failure to comply with the Statute of Frauds if it is established that the party seeking enforcement, in reasonable reliance on the contract and on the continuing assent of the party against whom enforcement is sought, has so changed his position that injustice can be avoided only by specific enforcement (emphasis supplied).

### Issue:
Did the Hickeys rely on Mrs. Greene? Was there a contract?

### Holding:
Ye

### Rationale:

The Hickeys, relying on Mrs. Green’s oral promise, moved rapidly to make their sale without obtaining any adequate memorandum of the terms of what appears to have been intended to be a quick cash sale of Lot S. So rapid was action by the Hickeys that, by July 21, less than ten days after giving their deposit to Mrs. Green, they had accepted a deposit check for the sale of their house, endorsed the check, and placed it in their bank account. Above their signatures endorsing the check was a memorandum probably sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.

At the very least, the Hickeys had bound themselves in a manner in which, to avoid a transfer of their own house, they might have had to engage in expensive litigation. No attorney has been shown to have been used either in the transaction between Mrs. Green and the Hickeys or in that between the Hickeys and their purchaser. 

There is no denial by Mrs. Green of the oral contract between her and the Hickeys. This, under §129 of the Restatement, is of some significance. There can be no doubt (a) that Mrs. Green made the promise on which the Hickeys so promptly relied, and also (b) she, nearly as promptly, but not promptly enough, repudiated it because she had a better opportunity. 

### Judgement:
The case is remanded to the Superior Court Department for further action consistent with this opinion. The Hickeys are to have costs of this appeal.
