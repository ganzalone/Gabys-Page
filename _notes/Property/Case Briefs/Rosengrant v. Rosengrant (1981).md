## Rule of Law

A property transfer is only valid if the transferor intends for the transfer to take effect immediately upon delivery of the deed.

## Facts

Harold and Mildred Rosengrant were an older couple who owned a farm together. They had no children, but had several nieces and nephews. When Mildred became sick, their nephew Jay (defendant) came to take care of the farm. In appreciation for his help, Mildred and Harold sought to transfer their farm to him. They brought Jay to a bank where Harold handed the deed to him, which the banker said was necessary to make the transfer legal. Harold and Mildred instructed Jay to give the deed to the bank for safekeeping. They instructed Jay to record the deed upon their death. Harold and Mildred continued to live on the property. When they both died, Jay recorded the deed. However, other family members (plaintiffs) challenged the transfer of the property to Jay for failure to properly deliver the deed. The trial court agreed. Jay then appealed to the Court of Appeals of Oklahoma.

## Issue

Is a property transfer only valid if the transferor intends for the transfer to take effect immediately upon delivery of the deed?

## Holding and ReasoningÂ (Boydston, J.)

Yes. A property transfer is only valid if the transferor intends for the transfer to take effect immediately upon delivery of the deed. A property transfer is invalid if the transferor delivers the deed intending for the transfer to later take effect upon the transferor's death. A party must intend to deliver a deed at the time actual delivery takes place. In this case, Harold and Mildred did not properly deliver the deed to their farm to Jay because they did not intend to transfer the deed at the time the actual transfer took place. Instead, Harold and Mildred continued to live on the farm. Furthermore, the couple instructed Jay not to record the deed until they passed. These circumstances demonstrate an intent to deliver the deed to the farm after their death, not at the time actual delivery took place. A person wishing to transfer a deed after death must do so through a properly executed will. Since Harold and Mildred did not transfer the deed by will, and because they intended to transfer the deed only after their deaths, not at the time they delivered the deed to Jay, delivery of the deed did not take place. The judgment of the court below is affirmed.
