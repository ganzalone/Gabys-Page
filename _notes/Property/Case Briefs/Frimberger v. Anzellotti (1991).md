## Rule of Law

A latent violation of land use statutes or regulations is not considered an encumbrance making the title to the land unmarketable.

## Facts

DiLoreto owned property adjacent to a wetlands area. He built a bulkhead and filled a portion of the land, and built a house on the property. He later conveyed the land to Frimberger (defendant), who sold the land to Anzellotti (plaintiff) by warranty deed, free of encumbrances but subject to zoning and building restrictions. 

- Anzellotti undertook repairs to the bulkhead and filled areas of the property. Because the land was governed by state laws governing wetlands, he engaged several engineers to assess the land. 
- He discovered that the filled and bulkheaded portion of the land, as well as part of the house, were unlawfully abutting the wetlands. The engineers advised Anzellotti that the violation could be remedied if he filed an application explaining why the bulkhead and fill were necessary. 
- Instead of filing this application, Anzellotti sued Frimberger alleging breach of warranty against encumbrances. 

## Procedure 
The trial court found in favor of Anzellotti and awarded him damages of $47,792.60, which included the cost of correcting the violation and the diminution in value of the property due to the violation. Frimberger appealed.

## Issue

Whether an existing violation of a land use statute is a breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

## Holding and Reasoning (Lavery, J.)

No. **An encumbrance is any interest in land which may be exercised by third parties affecting the value of the land, although the land may still be transferred by conveyance. An encumbrance which renders the title unmarketable represents a violation of the covenant against encumbrances.** 

The court looks to _Fahmie v. Wulster_, 81 NJ 391 (1979), a New Jersey case, for guidance. In _Fahmie_, the court held that an encumbrance was not created by a need to correct structures built on the land to conform to existing land use regulations. The New Jersey court suggested that the better course of action with respect to land use violations was to include contractual provisions in the contract addressing the possibility of the need for such corrections. 

- Here, the defect on the land was latent and existed at the time of the conveyance, but at the time of its discovery it was unclear that any governmental entity was preparing to initiate proceedings based on the violation. Because violations of this kind do not tend to appear on land records, and because there is no imminent threat of governmental action to enforce the regulations, these cannot rise to the level of an encumbrance rendering the title unmarketable.

- Because Anzellotti never filed the application as suggested by the engineers, any damages that he alleges in this suit are speculative. In fact, because Anzellotti is an attorney and knowledgeable of wetlands regulations, he could have avoided this problem by ordering a survey of the land before the purchase or by including contract terms to the sale addressing the potential existence of land use violations. The judgment of the trial court is reversed.
