*Supreme Court of Kansas, 1951 227 P.2d 102 *

Plaintiff(s): Dr. Lohmeyer
Defendant(s): Bowers 

### Procedural history:
Dr. Lohmeyer brought suit to rescind the contract and demanded return of his earnest money. The Bowers answered, contesting Lohmeyer’s right to rescind, and by cross-complaint asked specific performance of the contract. The trial court rendered judgment for the Bowers and decreed specific performance of the contract. Dr. Lohmeyer appealed from that judgment.

### Facts:
- May 1949, Dr. K.L. Lohmeyer entered into a contract to buy from the Bowers lot number 37 in the Berkley Hills Addition to the city of Emporia. 
- The abstract of title showed that the original subdivider of the Berkley Hills Addition had, in 1926, imposed a restrictive covenant on lot 37 requiring any house erected on lot 37 to be two stories in height. Lot 37 had a one-story house on it. 
- Dr. Lohmeyer gave the abstract of title to a lawyer to examine, and from the lawyer Dr. Lohmeyer learned that the city of Emporia had a zoning ordinance providing that no frame building could be erected within three feet of a side or rear lot line. The frame house on lot 37 was located within 18 inches of the north line of the lot in violation of the ordinance. The Bowers had, in 1946, moved the house, which had been built elsewhere, onto lot 37. 
- When Dr. Lohmeyer brought the zoning violation to the attention of the Bowers, they offered to purchase and convey to Lohmeyer two feet along the entire north side of lot 37. Dr. Lohmeyer refused their offer.

### Rule of law:
  A marketable title to real estate is one which is free from reasonable doubt, and a title is doubtful and unmarketable if it exposes the party holding it to the hazard of litigation. To render the title to real estate unmarketable, the defect of which the purchaser complains must be of a substantial character and one from which he may suffer injury. Mere immaterial defects which do not diminish in quantity, quality or value the property contracted for, constitute no ground upon which the purchaser may reject the title.

### Issue: 
In this jurisdiction, does this title constitute a  constitutes a marketable or merchantable title? if so, are they excepted by the provision of the contract which reads “subject however, to all restrictions and easements of record applying to this property.” 

### Holding:
In a way - jk it doesnt but not bc why u think!

### Rationale:

 - Lohmeyer purchased the property subject to all restrictions of record he makes no complaint of the restrictions contained in the declaration. Plaintiff bases his right to rescission of the contract solely upon presently existing violations thereof. 
 - These violations are not such encumbrances or burdens on title as may be availed of by a vendee to avoid his agreement to purchase on the ground they render his title unmerchantable.
 - Appellees point to the contract which, it must be conceded, provides they shall have time to correct imperfections in the title and contend that even if it be held the restrictions and the ordinance have been violated they are entitled to time in which to correct those imperfections. 
 -  **it is the violation of the restrictions imposed by both the ordinance and the dedication declaration, not the existence of those restrictions, that render the title unmarketable. **

### Judgement:
reversal of the judgment with directions to the trial court to cancel and set aside the contract and render such judgment as may be equitable and proper under the issues raised by the pleadings.
