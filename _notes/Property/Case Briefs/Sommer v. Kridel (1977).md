# Sommer v. Kridel

Supreme Court of New Jersey

74 N.J. 446, 378 A.2d 767 (1977)

## Rule of Law

A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages when he seeks to recover rents due from a defaulting tenant.

## Facts

Kridel (defendant) signed a two year lease with Sommer (plaintiff) and paid the first month’s rent and the security deposit. However, before Kridel was expected to move in, he wrote a letter to Sommer stating that his engagement had broken off and as a result he would no longer have the money to pay the rent. During the lease term a third party inquired about and was ready and willing to lease Kridel’s vacant unit, but Sommer told them that the unit was already rented to Kridel. Sommer did not show the apartment to anyone else until over a year after he received the letter from Kridel. Sommer brought suit against Kridel seeking rent for the entire two years of the lease. The trial court found in favor of Kridel. The New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division reversed. The Supreme Court of New Jersey granted certification. _Riverview Realty Co. v. Perosio_, 350 A.2d 517 (1977) was a companion case included in the decision.

## Issue

Does a landlord have a duty to mitigate damages when seeking rent from a defaulting tenant?

## Holding and Reasoning (Pashman, J.)

Yes. A landlord has a duty to mitigate damages by making a reasonable effort to re-let the premises when seeking to recover rent from a defaulting tenant. Such a duty is consistent with basic justice and fairness. There is an increasing trend to treat leases not as conveyances of land, but as contracts. As a result, application of the contract doctrine of mitigation of damages is appropriate. If a landlord fails to mitigate damages when he has the opportunity, the defaulting tenant may be relieved of his duty to pay rent. In this case, a third party was ready, willing, and able to rent Kridel’s apartment and asked specifically about it. This actually made Sommer’s duty to mitigate damages very easy as it would have taken little to no effort to re-let the apartment. But Sommer told the third party the apartment was not available, thus failing in his duty. 

## Judgement: 
The court finds in favor of Kridel, and the decision of the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division is reversed.
