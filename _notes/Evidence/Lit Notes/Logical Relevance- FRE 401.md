Any tendency to make
fact of consequence
more or less probable


"any tendency"- probative
"more or less probable"- material 

- Most evidence is logically relevant (probative & material) â€“ very low threshold!
- Relevance depends upon the law governing the controversy  
- Relevance may evolve as a trial progresses (not stagnant)
- Context affects relevance
- Relevant evidence is not automatically admissible.

May be INADMISSIBLE if unfair prejudice SUBSTANTIALLY outweighs probative value
