**Civil** Compromise Offers (Settlement) & Negotiations

a) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of the following is not admissible  
— on behalf of any party either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction:  

(1) furnishing, promising, or offering — or accepting,  
promising to accept, or offering to accept — a valuable  
consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise the claim; and  

(2) conduct or a statement made during compromise  
negotiations about the claim — except when offered in a  criminal case and when the negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory, investigative, or enforcement authority.  

Excludes such evidence if a party attempts to use it:  
1. To prove the validity or amount of a claim;  
2. To disprove the validity or amount of a claim;  
3. To impeach a witness’s testimony through a prior inconsistent statement or contradiction

- Applies to all parties  
- Defines compromise offers and acceptance very broadly
- Protects all conduct or statements made during compromise negotiations, not just offers and acceptances

- Parties must be disputing some aspect of the claim
- The statements or conduct must occur during those “negotiations” or “while compromising or attempting to compromise”
