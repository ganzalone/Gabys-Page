• opinion of person’s character  

On cross-examination of the character witness, the court may allow an inquiry into relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct.



Rule 405(b) – Methods of Proving Character  
**By Specific Instances of Conduct.**
When a person’s character or  
character trait is an essential element of a charge, claim, or  
defense, the character or trait may also be proved by relevant  
specific instances of the person’s conduct.

Rule 404(a)(2) – “Mercy Rule”  

Defendant offers own pertinent character trait. Prosecution MAY:  
- Rebut by cross examination with specific instances to undercut character witness’ testimony;
- Rebut with own character witness saying defendant has opposite trait.  

MAY NOT: Rebut by showing victim has the same trait

****DEFENDANT CAN ONLY ORIGINALLY OFFER OPINION OR REPUTATION, AFTER CROSS EXAMINATION CAN OFFER SPECIFIC INSTANCES****

Once defendant offers pertinent trait of victim, prosecution can:  
- Cross examine character witness about specific instances to test character witness’s opinion/reputation testimony
- Put on evidence of opposite trait for victim
- Put on evidence that defendant possesses the SAME trait

Only time prosecution can put on evidence of victim’s trait BEFORE defendant has put on evidence of victim’s trait is in homicide case if defendant has put on evidence that victim was first aggressor
