*a subsequent remedial measure is when a person was injured, and a defendant later repaired the thing or condition that had caused the injury.*

When measures are taken that would have made an earlier injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove:  
• negligence;  
• culpable conduct;  
• a defect in a product or its design; or  
• a need for a warning or instruction.  

But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as impeachment or — if disputed — proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures.


Rule 407 encourages people to learn from their mistakes and take corrective actions. Absent Rule 407, a person may not make improvements if the injured can use the corrective actions in a lawsuit against them.

*Ask:
• What is the measure?  
• When was the injury?  
• When did the measure occur? 
• What is the measure being offered to prove?  
• Who took the measure?*
