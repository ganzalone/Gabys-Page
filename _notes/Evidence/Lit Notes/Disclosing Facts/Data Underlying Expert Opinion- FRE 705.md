Unless the court orders otherwise, an expert may state an opinion – and give the reasons for it – without first testifying to the underlying facts or data. But the expert may be required to disclose those facts or data on cross-examination.

Experts may not disclose inadmissible evidence, unless:  

• Rule 703: The court determines the probative value of admitting the facts to help the jury evaluate the expert’s opinion substantially outweighs the prejudice of admitting the facts; OR  

• Rule 705: Opposing counsel asks about the underlying facts on cross-examination
