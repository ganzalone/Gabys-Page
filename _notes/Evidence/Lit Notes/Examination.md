Order of  
Examination  
1. Direct  
2. Cross  
3. Re-Direct  
4. Re-Cross

**Direct Examination**  
• Introduce witness to jurors  
• Lay foundation: Establish witness’s personal knowledge  
• Allow witness to tell story

Although leading questions are allowed on direct examination under certain circumstances (or if opponent doesn’t object), it’s usually a bad strategy and can negatively impact your case.

**Cross Examination**
- Testing witness’s testimonial  
capacities
- Filling gaps in testimony/evidence
- Corroborating parts of cross-examiner’s case
- Impeach witness’s credibility
