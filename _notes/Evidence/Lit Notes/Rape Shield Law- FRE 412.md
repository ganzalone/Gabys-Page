Rule 412(a) bars in any proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct:  

(1) Evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior; or  

(2) Evidence offered to prove a victim’s sexual predisposition.

Barred evidence includes:  
• Evidence related to the alleged victim’s mode of  
dress, speech, or life-style;  
• Activities of the minds, such as fantasies or dreams; and  
• Evidence that implies sexual conduct such as use of contraceptives, child outside of marriage, or presence of STD

The court may admit the following evidence in a **criminal case:**
(A) evidence of specific instances of a victim’s sexual behavior, if offered to prove that someone other than the defendant was the source of semen, injury, or other physical evidence;  

(B) evidence of specific instances of a victim’s sexual behavior with respect to  
the person accused of the sexual misconduct, if offered by the defendant to prove consent or if offered by the prosecutor; and  

(C) evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant’s constitutional rights.
