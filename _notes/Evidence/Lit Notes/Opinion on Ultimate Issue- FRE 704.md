a) In General – Not Automatically Objectionable. 

An opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.  

(b) Exception. 
In a criminal case, an expert witness must not state an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense. Those matters are for the trier of fact alone.

AVOID FINAL LEGAL CONCLUSIONS:

guilty/not guilty:
an expert can’t simply proclaim that a defendant is guilty of cocaine trafficking. However,  
they can describe how a typical cocaine packing operation works and then leave it up to the fact finder to determine whether defendant’s activities  
fit the description of that which would make them  
guilty. 

mens rea:
A psychological diagnosis is allowed under 704(b), if  
there is still room for the fact finder to accept or deny the diagnosis and then determine whether the defendant had the legally required mens rea to  
commit the crime.
