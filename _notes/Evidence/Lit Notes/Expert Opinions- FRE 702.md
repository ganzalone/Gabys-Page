1. Reliable principles and methods  
	1. *Daubert* Factors
	- Has the theory been tested?
	- Has it been subjected to peer review and publication?
	- Is there a known or potential error rate?
	- Are there standards controlling technique’s operation?
	- Has the theory been generally accepted?
1. Technique reliably applied
	- Followed rules of method/test
	- Applied in proper context
	- Ruled out other explanations, if appropriate
2. Evidence fits the facts (helpful)
	- Does the testimony fit the dispute?
	- Does it add a perspective that jurors couldn’t provide on their own?
	- Does the testimony make sense?
4. Rule 403
	1. Reverse Balancing Test
	-  If the court determines that the probative value of the otherwise inadmissible evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, then it may be allowed.
	- Rule 703 only takes into consideration the probative value of the evidence in helping the jury evaluate the expert’s opinion


Scientific Evidence:

Hard Sciences  
• Math, physics, chemistry, etc.  
• Often labeled as “the only type of science” because usually fits neatly into models of  reliability  
• More easily accepted as legitimate area of expertise but should not be automatically accepted  

Soft Sciences  
• Psychology, political science, and other sciences that use subjective measures and designs rather than objective ones  
• Evidentiary decisions related to soft sciences are quite varied because of room for interpretation but judges must apply Daubert standards fairly





Evidence SUPPORTING expert opinion:

*independently admissible:*
May use to show truth of the matter asserted AND to evaluate the expert’s opinion

*admitted under 703:*
admissible only to evaluate expert's opinion

**Confrontation Clause**
The Sixth Amendment bars the  
prosecution from admitting  
“testimonial” hearsay against a  
criminal defendant.  

Rule 703 allows an expert witness to base opinion on inadmissible evidence as long as “experts” in the field “reasonable rely” on such  
evidence.  

Note: If not testimonial in nature, then there is no issue. It is only when it is testimonial in nature.
