# Performance of a Condition
Created: 2022-09-20 00:11

Has there been strict or substantial compliance with the condition?

1. Strict compliance- Did the party whose performance was subject to an express or implied condition satisfy it completely? If so, then the condition has been fulfilled and the other party's duty to perform arises. If the condition has not been satisfied, then the other party's duty to perform does not arise unless the condition has been excused or waived
	1. Excused- was it excused?
		1. Yes- tea! promisor may still be obligated to perform. (unless it was a material part of the contract)
		2. No- ok then it discharges the duty byeee
	2. Waived?- was that waived? A party may waive a condition that solely benefits the party waiving it. See [[Omni Group, Inc. v. Seattle-First National Bank (1982)]]
		1. Yes- promisor it's time to perform baby!
		2. non-occurence discharges other party's duty to perform
	3. Waiver retracted?- before the time for occurence of the condition had expired?
		1. Yes- condition may be reinstated unless other party relied on the waiver so that retraction would be unjust
		2. No- condition remains waived

and of course:

2. Substantial compliance- did the party provide substantial compliance with their performance? 
	1. Yes- ok cool good job # fulfilled/satisfied
	2. No- yall have FAILED to meet the condition and now the other party doesnt have to do ANYTHING
