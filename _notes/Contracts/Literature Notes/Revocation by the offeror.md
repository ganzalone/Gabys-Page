# Revocation by the offeror
Created: 2022-09-02 14:05

- The offeror is free to revoke her offer at any time before it is effectively accepted unless the offeror qualifies it as an option or is made irrevocable. 
- Offeror may revoke even if the offer promises to be held open for a set amount of time- backed by the necessity of consideration 
- Revocation must be communicated to the offeree to be effective, direct or indirectly
	1. Direct: offeror directly notifies offeree that the offer is off the table
	2. Indirect: offeror acts in a way that is inconsistent with an intent to enter the contract and offeree acquires this information via a reliable source
general offers must be revoked by using equal or better means of communication (ex: newspaper ads revoke in newspaper)
