# Integration
Created: 2022-09-02 17:42

- if parties intended a writing to be a final and perhaps a complete expression of their agreement, the writing is said to be "integrated"
- When it is final and complete, the writing is a complete integration. Complete integrations cannot be contradicted by any type of evidence, nor supplemented by consistent/non-contradictory additional terms. 
- When it is final with respect to the terms it contains, but does not express all of the parties' agreements, then it is a partial integration. Partial integrations may be supplemented but not contradicted
- Applies only to evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements
