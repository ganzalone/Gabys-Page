Complete or partial? who's to say

1. completely integrated- writing is a final and complete statement of parties' agreement. **Evidence of even consistent additional terms may not be admitted, however writig may be explained or supplemented by course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance.
	1. merger clause?- is there a merger or integration clause in the agreeement? presence of such a clause is great evidence of an integrated agreement
	2. consistent additional terms- an agreement is not completely integrated if the writing omits a consistent additional term which is agreed to for separate consideration or such a term as in the circumstances might naturally be ommitted from the writing [[ยง216. Consistent Additional Terms]]
2. Partially integrated- does not contain all agreements of party, final expression only of those contained within it. **evidence of additional terms is admissible as long as it does not contradict a term within the writing**
	1. consistent?- if offered term is consistent with the writing, it is admissible
	2. contradictory- if the evidence is contradictory, it is barred by the parol evidence rule
