# Determining Contractual Meaning
Created: 2022-09-19 20:02

- Intent of the parties is central in determining contract meaning- but how?
- Many courts use the **"plain meaning rule"**, looking at solely the contract itself to interpret the language. If contractual language appears unambiguous, then extrinsic evidence is inadmissible.
- **the "contextual" approach** considers all the proffered evidence before deciding whether the contract language is reasonably susceptible to the meaning claimed. The court will use extrinsic evidence in this case to determine what the language meant to the parties who used it-- this is what the restatements use!
