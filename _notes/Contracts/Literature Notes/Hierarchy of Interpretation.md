Omg it's the Hierarchy of Interpretation!!!
if the court allows the admission of extrinsic evidence, it follows a sequence to interpret the agreement.

1. **Course Performance**- Does the conduct of the parties in the course of performing the contract provide an answer? See Restatement [[§202. Rules in Aid Of Interpretation]] . If the parties have started performance, their conduct may provide evidence of what they intended the language to mean!
2. **Course of dealing**- Have the parties engaged in prior dealings? This might help interpret the term in the dispute of the present. See [[§223. Course of Dealing]]
3. **Trade usage**- Applicable usage of trade? Might be considered in giving meaning to the agreement. [[§222. Usage of Trade]]
4. **Essential Omitted Terms**- did the parties fail to include a term which has turned out to be essential to a determination of rights & duties of the parties? If so, court may supply a term which is reasonable in the circumstances, and if it is possible to do so by logical deduction from the agreed terms & circumstances. [[§204. Supplying an Omitted Essential Term]]
5. **Good Faith Babey!!!!! (and reasonableness)-** [[§205. Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing]] Basically don't be shady
6. **General Rules of Construction**- rules to help draw your inferences<3 
	1. is there a way to interpret the ambiguous term that gives effect to all the terms in the agreement?
	2. is the term able to be interpreted by ordinary meaning, or is there specialized meaning?
	3. Is it a specific provision? If so, it has greater weight.
	4. Are general & specific words connected? Yea? Ok bet then the general word is limited by the specificity, so it means only things of the same kind.
	5. Is there a specific list of items without being followed by a general term? If so, implication is that all other things of the same kind are excluded.
