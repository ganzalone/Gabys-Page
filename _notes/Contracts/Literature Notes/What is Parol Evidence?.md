Created: 2022-09-02 17:39

"Parol evidence" is any evidence other than the parties' written agreement that is offered by a party to prove contract terms that do not appear in the writing. 

- Helps determine the scope of the subject matter to be interpreted while the principles of interpretation provide the means for doing so
- An issue involving the parol evidence rule only arises when the last expression between the parties is in writing, AND when a valid contract exists
