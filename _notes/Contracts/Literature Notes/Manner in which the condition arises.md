2. **Manner in which the condition arises
	1. Express condition- parties agreed to make a condition of performance by using particular language
		1. Yes- ok gotta comply with condition required
		2. No- ok next
	2. Implied condition- contextual evidence that the parties intended a performance to be conditional without saying it explicitly? :O 
		1. Yes- ya mama. it's implied in fact and compliance is a must
		2. No- next ! [[Constructive Condition]] time!
