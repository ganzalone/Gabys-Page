Created: 2022-09-02 14:11

- Rejection of the offer by the offeree terminates the power of acceptance, and the offeree can no longer accept the offer. 
- Addition to terms is a counter-offer, and thus a rejection of the original offer.

- ยง40 states the power to accept ends on the offeror's receipt of the rejection, so that the offeree is bound
