Created: 2022-09-02 17:01

The maker of a promise may be bound by that promise, even though it is not supported by consideration if the promisee relies upon the promise to her detriment and the promisor should have foreseen this reliance. 

-If promisee relied to their detriment on a promise which the promisor could reasonably foresee would induce such reliance and injustice can only be avoided by enforcement of the promise, then the promise is enforceable.
-reliance must be of definite and substantial character
