# Parol Evidence
Created: 2022-09-03 19:36

Is one party seeking to introduce evidence of another agreement, either oral or written, to show that the terms of the written agreement are other than as shown in the writing?

1. Separate agreement- it's a separate agreement for separate consideration: **parol evidence does not apply, evidence is admissible 
2. Subsequent agreement- is it a subsequent agreement, one entered AFTER the written agreement? **Parol evidence does not apply** 
3. Condition precedent- was the contract subject to a condition precedent? **Evidence is not barred
4. Other purposes- is the evidence shown meant to prove the agreement to be invalid due to mistake, fraud, etc.? **Evidence is admissible 
5. Prior or contemporaneous agreement- is it evidence of a prior/contemporaneous written/oral agreement? **It's parol evidence time. Next:** [[The Integration Question]]
