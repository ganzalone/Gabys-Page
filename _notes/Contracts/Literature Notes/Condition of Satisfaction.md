Has the party made its promised performance conditional on their personal satisfaction or that of a third party?

1. Subjective Standard- is the contract for personal services where taste or judgement is involved?
	1. Yes- standard is subjective, but must be exercised in good faith. 
	2. No- ok next!
2. Objective standard- is it a commercial contract involving manufacturing or construction where objective criteria is available?
	1. Yes- ok cool standard is objective and requires satisfaction of a reasonable person
	2. No- R2d 228 says theres a preference for use of objective standard of reasonableness to avoid forfeiture. 

Ok how about [[Performance of a Condition]] though ...
