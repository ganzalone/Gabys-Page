integrated or unintegrated? well:
1. prepared by one party?- if that shit was made by one guy, probably unintegrated, **parol evidence is admissible.
2. memo to file- if it's a memo to file, probably unintegrated, **parol evidence is admissible.
3. final as to one term- if the writing is final as to at least one term, then the writing **is integrated, parol evidence bars evidence of prior negotiations for at least certain purposes. Next:** [[Degree of Integration]]
