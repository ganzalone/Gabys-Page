- Contracts are consensual and voluntary, based on terms and conditions agreed upon.
- We hold freedom from a contract, as there can be no force held against us to agree to terms. 
- Contract law lives in the records of judicial decisions. Restatements are not law, but set precedents from previous cases. However, when articles of the UCC are adopted by states (ex articles 1 & 2) they become law.
