# Constructive Condition
Created: 2022-09-20 00:04

Are the circumstances & the nature of the contract such that a condition SHOULD be present? Would a reasonable ass mf put one in?

1. Yes- ok the court will construe a condition. Strict compliance not required, substantial performance is permissible.
2. No- Court will not supply a condition

BUT WAIT- what about the [[Condition of Satisfaction]]?
