# The Mailbox Rule
Created: 2022-09-02 14:25

- When a contract is formed via correspondence, the mechanics of assent follow the mailbox rule
- Rule holds that an acceptance is effective upon dispatch 
- Upon dispatch- the mailbox rule also binds the offeree to the acceptance and it now becomes too late for the offeree to either reject the offer or revoke the acceptance 
- *dispatch must be made in a manner and medium invited*
- only applies to acceptances, not revocations: revocation is not effective until received by the offeree *upon receipt*

- mailbox rule binds offeree as well: once offeree has mailed an acceptance it is too late for the offeree to then reject the offer or withdraw the acceptance
