# Silence & Dominion As Acceptance
Created: 2022-09-02 15:59

- Mere silence does not constitute acceptance, however a promise of acceptance may be inferred by an offeree's exercise of dominion over the offered property
- Additional exception is when offeree takes the benefit of offered services with the opportunity to reject them, knowing that they were made with the expectation of payment
