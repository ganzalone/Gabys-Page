Created: 2022-09-19 23:30


**Conditions**- is it a condition? 

1. **Timing of the condition- is there an order to it?
	1.  Precedent- does the condition need to be satisfied before the performance?
		1. Yes- ok bet condition precedent, must occur before contractual duty becomes due
		2. No- next question girlie pop!
	2. Subsequent- is the condition one that discharges a duty already in existence?
		1. Yes- ok condition subsequent<3
		2. No- Next!
	3. Concurrent- are the conditions dependent on eachother so that the performances are conditions of eachother?
		1. Yes- ok performances due at the same time bestie!
		2. No- uhhh ya mama. JK! Though if there's doubt as far as order goes, simultaneous performance is a nice compromise :)

Ok now peep this: [[Manner in which the condition arises]]
