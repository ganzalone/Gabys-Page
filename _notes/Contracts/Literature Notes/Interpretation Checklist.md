# Interpretation Checklist
Created: 2022-09-19 21:01

**Contract meaning**- do the parties dispute the meaning of a term in their contract? If the parties disagree as to the meaning of language in their agreement, then the court may be called to interpret the agreement. 

**Extrinsic Evidence**- will the court allow the admission of extrinsic evidence to interpret the contract language?
1. Sale of Goods- if the contract is for a sale of goods, UCC doesn't require a finding of ambiguity before evidence can be admitted. Jump to [[Statutory Interpretation]]
2. Common law- is it for services? common law baby. Onwards to [[Hierarchy of Interpretation]]
3. Contextual approach- For the Restatement Second Sec. 212 girlies. All relevant extrinsic evidence is admissible, allows consideration of all credible evidence to prove intent of the parties. 
4. Plain meaning- if you're dealing with a plain meaning jurisdiction, then you can only look at the language directly within the contract- NO outside evidence. If the judge determines it is a clear expression, sorry shawty no dice.
