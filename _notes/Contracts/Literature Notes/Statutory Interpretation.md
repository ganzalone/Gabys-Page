Yooo the contract involves the sale of goods yoooooo
Ok FIRST you gotta interpret the parties' agreement (DIFFERENT FROM INTERPRETING THE STATUTE)

1. **Express contractual terms**- can the intent of the parties be determined from the express terms of the agreement? Yea? Ok then that language controls. 
2. **Parties' course of performance, course of dealing, usage of trade**- course of performance prevails over the other two under the code. Course of dealing > usage when determining meaning of an agreement. Express terms always prevail over all though.
3. **Statutory language**- is the statutory language clear, have a common understanding, use plain language, etc.? If it's ambiguous, it's [[Judicial Interpretation]] time babey.
4. **Official comments**- Does the code commentary provide clarification of the term in question?
5. **Commentators and Experts**- is there expert commentary available to interpret the language?
6. **Legislative History**- is there legislative history to assist in ascertaining the meaning given to the language at issue?
