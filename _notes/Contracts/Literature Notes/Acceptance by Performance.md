# Acceptance by Performance
Created: 2022-09-02 14:22

- If the offer seeks acceptance by performance and not by return promise, then contract can only be formed via performance of the requested performance. 
- offer not accepted until performance is completed. There is no contract & legal liability does not attach until offeree has fully performed.
- Offeree need not give notice of intent to perform, but must render the performance for effective acceptance.
