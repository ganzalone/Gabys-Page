### Drennan v. Star Paving Co.

Supreme Court of California

333 P.2d 757 (1958)

## Facts

Drennan (plaintiff), a general contractor, was preparing a bid for a school construction project. Drennan solicited bids from subcontractors to perform the paving work necessary for the project. Star Paving Co. (Star) (defendant) contacted Drennan and submitted a bid of $7,131.60 for the paving work. This was the lowest bid, and Drennan relied on Star’s bid when computing his own bid for the project. Drennan’s bid was lowest and he was ultimately awarded the general contract. Drennan promptly informed Star it was awarded the subcontract. However, Star informed Drennan that it had made a mistake in computing its bid and could only complete the work for $15,000. Drennan went to look for another subcontractor to perform the paving work. After months of searching, Drennan awarded a new subcontract to a company bidding $10,948.60 for the project; the lowest bid found by Drennan. 

## Procedure: 
Drennan brought suit against Star to recover damages caused by Star’s failure to perform work as specified in its bid. The trial court awarded Drennan $3,817.00, or the difference between Star’s bid and the final cost of paving to Drennan, plus costs. Star appealed.

## Issue

Whether detrimental reliance by one party on another party’s offer, without formal acceptance of the offer, is sufficient to make the offer irrevocable.

## Holding and Reasoning (Traynor, J.)

Yes. Star should have reasonably expected Drennan to rely on its bid when making his own bid, and Drennan did rely on the bid such that enforcement of the terms of Star’s bid is necessary to prevent injustice to Drennan. An offer which the offeror should reasonably expect to induce definite and substantial reliance by the offeree, and which does induce such reliance is binding on the offeror and enforceable even without consideration if enforcement is necessary to prevent injustice to the offeree. When reasonable reliance on the offer by the offeree results in a foreseeable negative change in the offeree’s position, a promise not to revoke the offer is implied on behalf of the offeror. Drennan already fulfilled his duty to mitigate damages by searching for months for the next lowest bidder, and thus the trial court’s award of $3,817.00, or the difference between Star’s bid and the final cost of paving to Drennan, is affirmed.

Defendant had reason to expect P to rely and bid and also want them to
