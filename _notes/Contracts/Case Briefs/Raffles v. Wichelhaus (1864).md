Created: 2022-08-28 12:29

### Casebook date, page number
*citation*

Plaintiff(s):
Defendant(s): Wichelhaus

### Procedural history:

### Issue:
Whether a mutual misunderstanding of the parties invalidates a contract.

### Facts:
 (defendant) entered into a contract to buy 125 bales of cotton from Raffles (plaintiff). Under the terms of the contract, the cotton was to arrive from Bombay via the ship Peerless. 

-Raffles delivered the cotton to a ship named Peerless, which departed from Bombay in December. Wichelhaus refused to pay. 

-Wichelhaus argued that the cotton was to be delivered by a different ship also called Peerless, which had departed Bombay in October. Raffles sued for breach of contract.

### Rule of law:

### Holding:
Yes

### Judgement:
The judgment is thus for Wichelhaus.

### Rationale:
There is no contract if there is a mutual misunderstanding by the parties as to the meaning of a term of the agreement. There is nothing on the face of the contract to indicate which Peerless ship was to deliver the cotton. Where there is a latent ambiguity as to meaning, parties may offer parol evidence to explain the terms. In this case, the evidence shows that Wichelhaus meant one Peerless and Raffles meant another. Thus, there was no meeting of the minds and, hence, no binding contract.
