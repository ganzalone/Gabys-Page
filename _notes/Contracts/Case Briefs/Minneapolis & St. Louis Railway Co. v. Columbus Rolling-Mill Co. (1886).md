Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway Co. v. Columbus Rolling-Mill Co.

United States Supreme Court

119 U.S. 149 (1886) no 2-207 UCC because it wasnt in existence lol

## Facts

On December 5, 1879, Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway Co. (Minneapolis) (plaintiff) sent a letter to Columbus Rolling-Mill Co. (Columbus) (defendant) requesting a quote for the price of 2,000 to 5,000 tons of iron rails. Defendant replied in a letter sent December 8th, saying it would sell between 2,000 and 5,000 tons of iron rails for $54.00 per ton. On December 16th, Plaintiff sent a telegram to Defendant requesting an order of 1,200 tons of iron rails at $54.00 per ton. On December 18th, Defendant replied with a telegram saying that it would not fulfill this order. On December 19th, Plaintiff sent another telegram to Defendant requesting an order of 2,000 tons of iron rails at $54.00 per ton- did not reply. After repeated inquiries by Plaintiff, Defendant denied the existence of any contract between the parties on January 19, 1880. Minneapolis brought suit against Columbus for breach of contract. 

## Procedure: 
The trial court entered judgment for Columbus, and Minneapolis appealed.

## Issue

When an offer is made, must the acceptance be based upon the exact terms contained in the offer?

## Holding and Reasoning (Gray, J.)

Yes. Minneapolis’s acceptance of Columbus’ offer did not exactly mirror the terms of the offer, and thus is invalid. There is no binding contract between the parties, and the decision of the trial court is affirmed.
