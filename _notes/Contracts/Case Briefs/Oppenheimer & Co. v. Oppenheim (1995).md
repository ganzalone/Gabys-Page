Appeal, by permission of the Court of Appeals, from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department, entered June 23, 1994, which (1) reversed, on the law and the facts, an order and judgment (one paper) of the Supreme Court (Bruce McM. Wright, J.), entered in New York County, granting a motion by defendant to dismiss the complaint in its entirety after a jury verdict partially in favor of plaintiff, denying as moot a motion by plaintiff for prejudgment interest and awarding costs to defendant, (2) reinstated the jury verdict which found substantial performance by plaintiff and awarded plaintiff damages against defendant in the sum of $ 1.2 million, (3) granted plaintiff's motion for prejudgment interest, and (4) awarded costs to plaintiff.

Obligor and obligee entered a sublease agreement. The agreement provided that there would be no sublease until the obligee delivered to the obligor the prime landlord's written consent to perform certain tenant work. 

- The obligee provided timely oral notice, but not the written notice that was required by the terms of the lease agreement. 
- When the obligor failed to perform according to the lease terms, the obligee filed a complaint for breach of contract and alleged that it had substantially performed its part of the bargain. The trial court held in favor of the obligee. The court reversed the judgment, granted summary judgment in favor of the obligor, and dismissed the complaint. The court found that substantial performance had no application to the dispute. The parties' letter of agreement unambiguously established an express condition precedent rather than a promise. The sophisticated parties dealt at arm's length and there was no reason to relieve the consequences of their bargain. The court further held that the issue of whether there had been substantial performance was not for the jury but the judges of the law.

In 1986, plaintiff Oppenheimer & Co. moved to the World Financial Center in Manhattan, a building constructed by Olympia & York Company (O & Y). 

- At the time of its move, plaintiff had three years remaining on its existing lease for the 33rd floor of the building known as One New York Plaza. 
- As an incentive to induce plaintiff's move, O & Y agreed to make the rental payments due under plaintiff's rental agreement in the event plaintiff was unable to sublease its prior space in One New York Plaza.

In December 1986, the parties entered to this action entered into a   conditional letter agreement to sublease the 33rd floor. 

- Defendant already leased space on the 29th floor of One New York Plaza and was seeking to expand its operations. 
- The proposed sublease between the parties was attached to the letter agreement. The letter agreement provided that the proposed sublease would be executed only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.
- plaintiff was required to obtain "the Prime Landlord's written notice of confirmation, substantially to the effect that [defendant] is a subtenant of the Premises reasonably acceptable to Prime Landlord." 
- If such written notice of confirmation were not obtained "on or before December 30, 1986, then this letter agreement and the Sublease … shall be deemed null and void and of no further force and effect and neither party shall have any rights against nor obligations to the other."

Assuming satisfaction of the condition set forth in paragraph 1 (a), defendant was required to submit to plaintiff, on or before January 2, 1987, its plans for "tenant work" involving construction of a telephone communication linkage system between [6]  the 29th and 33rd floors. 

 letter agreement then obligated plaintiff to obtain the prime landlord's "written consent" to the proposed "tenant work" and deliver such consent  [417]   [736]  to defendant on or before January 30, 1987. 
 
 Furthermore, if defendant had not received the prime landlord's written consent by the agreed date, both the agreement and the sublease were to be deemed "null and void and of no further force and effect," and neither party was to have "any rights against nor obligations to the other." 
 
  - parties "agree not to execute and exchange the Sublease unless and until … the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) above are timely satisfied."

The parties extended the letter agreement's deadlines in writing and plaintiff timely satisfied the first condition set forth in paragraph 1 (a) pursuant to the modified deadline. 

However, plaintiff never delivered the prime landlord's written consent to the proposed tenant work on or before the modified final deadline of February 25, 1987. Rather, plaintiff's attorney [7]  telephoned defendant's attorney on February 25 and informed defendant that the prime landlord's consent had been secured. On February 26, defendant, through its attorney, informed plaintiff's attorney that the letter agreement and sublease were invalid for failure to timely deliver the  [689]  prime landlord's written consent and that it would not agree to an extension of the deadline. The document embodying the prime landlord's written consent was eventually received by plaintiff on March 20, 1987, 23 days after expiration of paragraph 4 (c)'s modified final deadline.

Plaintiff commenced this action for breach of contract, asserting that defendant waived and/or was estopped by virtue of its conduct 1 from insisting on physical delivery of the prime landlord's written consent by the February 25 deadline. Plaintiff further alleged in its complaint that it had substantially performed the conditions set forth in the letter agreement.

  At the outset of trial, the court issued an order in limine barring any reference to substantial performance of the terms of the letter agreement. Nonetheless, during the course of trial, the court permitted the jury to consider the theory of substantial performance, and additionally charged the jury concerning substantial performance. Special interrogatories were submitted. The jury found that defendant had properly complied with the terms of the letter agreement, and answered in the negative the questions whether defendant failed to perform its obligations under the letter agreement concerning submission of plans for tenant work, whether defendant by its conduct waived the February 25 deadline for delivery by plaintiff of the landlord's written consent to tenant work, and whether defendant by its conduct was equitably estopped from requiring plaintiff's strict adherence to the February 25 deadline. Nonetheless, the jury answered in the affirmative the question, "Did plaintiff substantially perform the conditions set forth in the Letter Agreement?," and awarded plaintiff damages of $ 1.2 million.

Defendant moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Supreme Court granted the motion, ruling as a matter of law that "the doctrine of substantial performance has no application to this dispute, where the Letter Agreement is free of all ambiguity in setting the deadline that plaintiff concededly did not honor." The Appellate Division reversed the judgment on the law and facts, and reinstated the jury verdict. The Court concluded that the question of substantial compliance was  properly submitted to the jury and that the verdict should be reinstated because plaintiff's failure to deliver the prime landlord's written consent was inconsequential.

This Court granted defendant's motion for leave to appeal and we now reverse.
