# Boise Junior College District v. Mattefs Construction Co.

Idaho Supreme Court

450 P.2d 604 (1969)

## Rule of Law

A bidder who makes an error in preparing a bid for a public works contract is entitled to the equitable relief of rescission if he proves that the mistake is material, enforcement of a contract based on the terms of the erroneous bid would be unconscionable, the mistake did not result from violation of a positive legal duty or from culpable negligence, the party to whom the bid is submitted will not be prejudiced except by the loss of his bargain, and prompt notice of the error is given.

## Facts

Mattefs Construction Co. (Mattefs) (defendant) submitted a bid of $141,048 for a construction contract with Boise Junior College District (Boise). 

Boise expected to pay $150,000 for the construction project. 

Mattefs’ bid contained a customary bid bond involving a promise to pay the difference between its bid and the next higher bid actually accepted by Boise if Mattefs refused to contract with Boise for some reason

. Unbeknownst to Mattefs at the time, its bid contained a clerical error which, if corrected, would have made Mattefs’ costs around $151,000 rather than $141,048. 

Boise ultimately awarded the contract to Mattefs, but Mattefs refused to sign the contract. Boise awarded the contract to the next higher bidder, Cain and Hardy, Inc., who bid $148, 915. 

Boise then brought suit against Mattefs in Idaho state court seeking to recover the difference in price between Mattefs’ bid and Cain and Hardy, Inc.’s bid. Mattefs sought the equitable remedy of rescission based on its clerical error. The trial court permitted rescission for Mattefs, and Boise appealed.

## Issue

Whether a bidder who makes an error in preparing a bid for a public works contract is ever entitled to the equitable relief of rescission.

## Holding and Reasoning (Spear, J.)

Yes. Mattefs is entitled to the equitable relief of rescission. A bidder who makes an error in preparing a bid for a public works contract is entitled to the equitable relief of rescission if he proves that the mistake is material, enforcement of a contract based on the terms of the erroneous bid would be unconscionable, the mistake did not result from violation of a positive legal duty or from culpable negligence, the party to whom the bid is submitted will not be prejudiced except by the loss of his bargain, and prompt notice of the error is given. First, Mattefs’ mistake is material because the erroneous price term in the bid amounted to approximately fourteen percent of its bid. Elsinore Union Elementary School Dist. V. Kastorff, 54 Cal.2d 380 (1960) is controlling. In that case, the court concluded that a mistaken underestimation of less than $3,000 in an $89,994 total contract was a material mistake, and permitted rescission. That mistake amounted to a smaller percentage of the total contract than does Mattef’s fourteen percent mistake, and thus Mattef’s mistake should be held to be material. Second, forcing Mattef to comply with its bid despite the material mistake would be unconscionable, as it would result in a $10,000 loss to Mattef. This amounts to a substantial pecuniary loss for Mattef, and thus Mattef should not be forced to comply with its bid. Third, there is no evidence that Mattef’s error in its bid was due to violation of a positive legal duty or from culpable negligence. Violation of a positive legal duty or culpable negligence are generally defined as carelessness or a lack of good faith amounting to gross negligence, rather than a mere clerical or inadvertent error such as was made by Mattef. Fourth, permitting Mattef to withdraw the bid will not impose a substantial hardship on Boise, as Boise will not actually suffer any loss from being forced to select Cain and Hardy, Inc.’s bid of $148,915 over Mattef’s bid of $141,048. Boise originally expected to pay $150,000 for the project, and thus is already saving almost $1,000. Mattef should not be forced to comply with its bid simply because Boise wishes to save approximately $9,000 instead of merely $1,000. Additionally, there is no reason to require Mattef to comply with its bid simply because Boise is a government entity, when Mattef would definitely be permitted the equitable remedy of rescission if Boise was a private sector party. Finally, there is no evidence that Boise was not given prompt notice as soon as the error was discovered by Boise. All the elements required for granting Mattef the equitable remedy of rescission are present. Mattef is entitled to rescission, and the decision of the trial court is affirmed.
