# Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)
Created: 2022-08-28 11:41

Carbolic Smoke Ball Co sold as a preventive advertising whoever uses it properly and gets sick will be given 100 pounds.Â 

An offer is not usually in an ad, however the intent shown within the ad of depositing funds into a bank shows a promise which makes it an offer. The acceptance of this offer would be the act and completion of performance. Carlill used as directed got sick and sued. Defendants appealed and it was dismissed. Performance of conditions is acceptance of the offer. Court underscores the fact that money was deposited in Bank showing.
