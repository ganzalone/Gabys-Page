## Rule of Law

A “subject to financing” clause included as a condition in a contract imposes upon the buyers an implied obligation to make a reasonable and good-faith effort to satisfy the condition by obtaining the requisite financing.

## Facts

The Hensels (plaintiffs) entered into a contract to sell their home to the Billmans (defendant) for $54,000. The contract required a $1,000 earnest money deposit from the Billmans. Additionally, **the contract included a “subject to financing” clause stating that the **contract was conditioned upon the ability of the Billmans to secure a conventional mortgage on the property for not less than $35,000 within thirty days.**

- The Billmans gave a check for $1,000 to the Hensels as earnest money. 
- Billmans met with Lincoln National Bank and Trust Company to discuss a mortgage. Mr. Billman was told that he could not obtain a mortgage for $35,000 unless he could come up with the difference between the purchase price ($54,000) and the mortgage. The Billmans were $6,500 short of the required balance. 
- Mr. Billman later told the Hensels that the deal was off because Mr. Billman’s parents would not loan him $5,000 needed to complete the financing. The Hensels offered to reduce the price of the home by $5,000. Mr. Billman rejected this offer, saying that he was still $1,500 of the required balance. 
- On October 4th, Mrs. Billman stopped payment on the check for earnest money given to the Hensels. 

## Procedure 

The Hensels brought suit in Indiana state court seeking payment of their $1,000 earnest money deposit by the Billmans. The trial court held that the Billmans were not excused from performance of the contract, and awarded $1,000 to the Hensels. The Billmans appealed.

## Issue

Does a “subject to financing” clause in a contract impose upon the buyers an implied obligation to make a reasonable and good-faith effort to satisfy the condition by obtaining the requisite financing?

## Holding and Reasoning (Garrard, J.)

Yes. The Billmans did not fulfill their obligation to make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain financing to purchase the Hensels’ home, and are thus not excused from performance of the contract.

- A “subject to financing” clause included as a condition in a contract imposes upon the buyers an implied obligation to make a reasonable and good faith effort to satisfy the condition by obtaining the requisite financing. This rule aligns with the reasonable expectations of the parties in making a contract of sale. Additionally, it is a logical extension of the general principle in contract law that a promisor cannot rely upon the existence of a condition precedent to excuse his performance where the promisor himself prevents performance of the condition. 

- The Billmans contacted only one financial institution about obtaining financing for $35,000, and did not attempt to seek a mortgage loan elsewhere when they were denied. The Billmans also made no formal loan application with any financial institution. In their contractual negotiations with the Hensels, the Billmans represented to the Hensels that they only needed a mortgage loan of $35,000 to complete the sale. In reality, the Billmans needed a mortgage of at least $42,500. Mr. Billman also said nothing to the Hensels about needing to obtain $5,000 from his parents to purchase the home, but stated his lack of ability to obtain $5,000 from his parents as his reason for canceling the contract for sale. Finally, when the Hensels offered to reduce the purchase price by $5,000 (the amount Mr. Billman stated he needed from his parents), Mr. Billman informed them that he was still short $1,500 and would not complete the sale. The Billmans’ lack of action in seeking out a mortgage loan and lack of candor in speaking with the Hensels about their finances indicate that the Billmans did not make a reasonable and good faith effort to satisfy the “subject to financing” clause in their contract with the Hensels. The Billmans are not excused from performance of the contract, and the decision of the trial court is affirmed.
