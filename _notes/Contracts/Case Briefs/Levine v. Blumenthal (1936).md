### Procedural history:

-   Term was 2 years, $2,100 for year 1 and $2,400 for year 2
    
-   D’s business was doing poorly, said they could not afford the increase in rent
    
-   P “agreed to allow them to remain under same rental ‘until business improved.’”
    
-   Oral agreement ^
    
-   The oral agreement to reduce rent was nudum pactum, and therefore created no binding obligation
    
-   *Must rest upon a new and independent consideration
    

### Rule of law:
Adequate additional consideration is necessary to support a subsequent agreement made by parties to a contract that changes the terms of the contract

Test: whether there is an additional consideration adequate to support an ordinary contract, and consists of something which the debtor was not legally bound to do or give

### Issue:
Does economic adversity constitute sufficient consideration to support a subsequent agreement made by parties to a contract that changes the terms of the contract?


### Holding:
No, the secondary agreement at issue is not supported by a valid consideration; and it therefore created no legal obligation

### Rationale:

### Judgement:
