## Rule of Law

There may be sufficient consideration to form an enforceable contract even though the parties have not bargained for the specific terms of the agreement.

## Facts

Pennsy Supply, Inc. (Pennsy) (plaintiff) entered into a contract to pave driveways and a parking lot for Northern York High School. Pennsy was required to use a base aggregate, which could be AggRite. Pennsy was notified that American Ash Recycling Corp. of Pennsylvania (American Ash) (defendant) would supply AggRite for free. By supplying the AggRite to Pennsy, American Ash avoided paying costs for the disposal of the AggRite. Pennsy collected the AggRite from American Ash and completed the paving project. After a year, the pavement developed defects due to the AggRite. Pennsy requested that American Ash remove and dispose of the AggRite, but American Ash refused. Pennsy filed suit. American Ash filed demurrers. The trial court sustained the demurrers, finding that the contract lacked consideration, and dismissed the complaint. Pennsy appealed to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.

## Issue

Is there sufficient consideration to form an enforceable contract even though the parties have not bargained for the specific terms of the agreement.

## Holding and Reasoning (Orie, J.)

Yes. Consideration must exist for there to be an enforceable contract. “Consideration consists of a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee.” A party must bargain for consideration in exchange for the promise. This bargained-for exchange, however, does not actually require the parties to bargain over the terms of the agreement. The promise and consideration need only be reciprocal inducement to each other. In the current matter, American Ash promised to supply AggRite free of charge. This promise induced Pennsy to assume the detriment of collecting and taking title to the material. It is true that the parties did not discuss and Pennsy did not understand that its acceptance of the AggRte would allow American Ash to avoid the disposal costs. However, this is not relevant to the consideration discussion, as it is not necessary for the parties to have bargained over the terms of the agreement. It is sufficient that American Ash’s promise to provide the AggRite was reciprocal inducement for Pennsy’s incurring the detriment of taking the AggRite. Accordingly, there was consideration for the contract. The decision of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
