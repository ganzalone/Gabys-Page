Created: 2022-08-28 11:48

### Casebook date, page number
*citation*

Plaintiff(s): Ever-Tite Roofing Corp.
Defendant(s): Green

### Procedural history:
 Ever-Tite brought suit against Green for breach of contract. The trial court held that Green gave Ever-Tite timely notice of withdrawal of the offer before Ever-Tite commenced performance of the work, and thus, no contract existed. Ever-Tite appealed.

### Issue: 
Whether an offer to form a contract may be accepted within a time frame specified by the offer, or if no time is specified, within a reasonable time.

### Facts:
Green (defendant) executed and signed a written offer on June 10, 1953 to secure the services of Ever-Tite Roofing Corp. (Ever-Tite) in re-roofing Green’s residence. Upon receiving Green’s offer, Ever-Tite completed the credit check and received approval for financing. The next day, Ever-Tite loaded its trucks with the materials required for Green’s project and dispatched laborers for the job to Green’s residence. Ever-Tite intended to accept Green’s offer by commencing performance of the work. When Ever-Tite’s trucks and laborers arrived at Green’s home, however, they found that Green had already hired another contractor to perform the work. Green notified Ever-Tite’s laborers that he had hired other parties to perform the work two days earlier, and forbade Ever-Tite from beginning the work.

### Rule of law:

### Analysis:

### Holding:
Yes. 

### Judgement:

### Rationale:
Ever-Tite accepted Green’s offer by commencing performance according to the terms of the offer within a reasonable time, and Green’s revocation of the offer constituted a breach of contract. A contract may be created by acceptance within a time frame specified by the offer or, if no time is specified, within a reasonable time. What constitutes a reasonable time is a question of fact that depends on the nature of the contract proposed, the common practices of the business at issue, and other circumstances of the case that the offeree, at the time of his acceptance, either knew or had reason to know.
