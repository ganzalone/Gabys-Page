# Bowling v. Sperry

Appellate Court of Indiana, Division No. 1

184 N.E.2d 901 (1962)

## Rule of Law

The contracts of minors are voidable and may be disaffirmed, with few exceptions.

## Facts

Larry Bowling (plaintiff), a minor, purchased an automobile from Max Sperry (defendant), for $140.00. When Bowling first looked at the car on Sperry’s car lot, he was accompanied by his aunt and grandmother. Bowling’s aunt test-drove the car, and loaned him $90.00 for the purchase price. The agreement for sale was executed solely between Bowling and Sperry. In the first week of driving the car, Bowling noticed that the main bearing was burned out. Bowling returned the car to Sperry, who said it would cost between $45.00 and $95.00 to make repairs. Bowling refused to pay for repairs, and left the car on Sperry’s lot. Bowling mailed a letter to Sperry disaffirming the contract of purchase and demanding the return of his money. Sperry refused, and Bowling brought suit against Sperry in Indiana state court. The trial court held for Sperry, and Bowling appealed.

## Issue

Whether the contracts of minors are voidable and may be disaffirmed.

## Holding and Reasoning (Myers, J.)

Yes. The contract between Bowling and Sperry is void due to Bowling’s minor status and act of disaffirming the contract. The contracts of minors are voidable and may be disaffirmed, with few exceptions. It is not necessary that the other party be returned to the status quo before the contract was made. It is also not necessary for the minor to return the money or property he received before suing for the value or possession of the money or property given to him by the adult. The minor may void a contract at any time while he is still a minor, or upon reaching adulthood. One possible exception to the rule that the contracts of minors are voidable and may be disaffirmed is if a contract with a minor involves the exchange of goods or services deemed to be “necessary” to the support, use, or comfort of the minor. “Necessaries” may include food, clothing, lodging, medical care, education, and personal comforts appropriate for the minor’s condition and circumstances in life. It is irrelevant that when Bowling purchased the car from Sperry, he was accompanied by his aunt and grandmother, and that his aunt loaned him $90.00 for the purchase price of the car. The contract was ultimately executed solely between Bowling and Sperry, and no one else. Additionally, it is irrelevant whether the problems with the car were due to Bowling’s failure to operate it correctly, as it is unnecessary for Sperry to be brought back to the status quo before the contract was made. All that matters is that the contract between Sperry and Bowling was formed when Bowling was a minor, and thus is voidable and may be disaffirmed. The car was not a “necessary” for Bowling. Although a large reason for Bowling purchasing the car was to use it to drive to and from his place of employment, Bowling could also ride to work with a fellow employee or possibly another person. This fact indicates that the car was not so needed by Bowling, given his situation in life, social status, and financial situation, that he could not be properly maintained without it. Thus, the contract between Bowling and Sperry, made when Bowling was a minor, is voidable and was properly disaffirmed by Bowling. The decision of the trial court is reversed.
