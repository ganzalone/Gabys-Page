## Rule of Law

Delay in delivery is not a breach if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made.

## Facts

The Federal Reserve Board (The Board) (plaintiff) invited manufacturers to submit proposals for computing systems. 

Early delivery was identified as a key consideration in selecting the best proposal. 

Wegematic Corp. (Wegematic) (defendant) submitted a detailed proposal for a new computer, which it claimed was "a truly revolutionary system utilizing all of the latest technical advances," and offered delivery nine months from the date the contract or purchase order was received. The Board ordered the computers and Wegematic accepted. 

-Wegematic subsequently twice delayed shipment and ultimately canceled the contract, citing “engineering difficulties.” The Board filed suit, and the court awarded it liquidated damages under the contract, damages for the excess cost of procuring replacement equipment, and for preparatory expenses. Wegematic appealed.

## Issue

Whether delay in delivery is excused if engineering difficulties of the manufacturer make delivery to the purchaser impossible.

## Holding and Reasoning (Friendly, J.)

No. Under UCC 2-615, delay in delivery is not a breach if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. Wegematic argues that delivery was made impossible by "engineering difficulties" whose correction – if possible - would have taken up to two years and would have cost over a million dollars. Here, where a product such as the Wegematic’s is advertised as a revolutionary breakthrough, the risk of the revolution's occurrence does not fall on the purchaser. In such cases, the purchaser can reasonably suppose that the technological breakthrough has already occurred or will occur in time for the manufacturer to deliver by the delivery date. The Board was not requesting that new products be developed for it but to be furnished computers. Accordingly the decision of the court below is affirmed.
