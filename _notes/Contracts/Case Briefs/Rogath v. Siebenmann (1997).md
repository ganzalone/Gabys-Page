## Rule of Law

If a buyer signs a contract with full knowledge of facts disclosed by the seller that would constitute breach of warranty under the terms of the contract, the buyer cannot then assert a claim for breach of warranty.

## Facts

Werner Siebenmann (defendant) sold a painting to David Rogath (plaintiff) for $570,000. Siebenmann warranted in the sale contract that the painting was an authentic self-portrait by Francis Bacon, and that he did not know of any challenges to the painting’s authenticity. 

- However, Siebenmann claimed that he informed Rogath about a potential challenge to the authenticity from an art gallery in London before Siebenmann and Rogath entered into the sale contract. Subsequently, Rogath sold the painting to a third party, but the third party returned the painting after it discovered a challenge to the painting’s authenticity. 

- Rogath accepted the returned painting and brought suit against Siebenmann for breach of warranty, among other things, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court granted Rogath’s motion for summary judgment on the breach of warranty claim. Siebenmann appealed.

## Issue

If a buyer signs a contract with full knowledge of facts disclosed by the seller that would constitute breach of warranty under the terms of the contract, can the buyer then assert a claim for breach of warranty?

## Holding and Reasoning (McLaughlin, J.)

No. If a buyer signs a contract with full knowledge of facts disclosed by the seller that would constitute breach of warranty under the terms of the contract, the buyer cannot then assert a claim for breach of warranty. In other words, the buyer is deemed to have waived his right to bring a breach of warranty claim if, going into the contract, the seller informed the buyer of facts that would give rise to a breach of warranty, and the buyer signed the contract anyway. If the facts were common knowledge or disclosed to the buyer by a third party, the buyer could bring a valid claim for breach of warranty. In that case, the buyer is deemed to have bought the seller’s warranty as insurance. The key issue is not whether the buyer believed the facts the seller warranted, but whether the buyer purchased the seller’s promise of the truth of the warranted facts. If a seller’s own disclosure contradicts his warranty, the buyer cannot be said to be purchasing the seller’s promise of the truthfulness of the warranty. In this case, there is a genuine issue of material fact surrounding Siebenmann’s disclosure to Rogath about the challenge from the London art gallery. Specifically, it must be determined what exactly Siebenmann told Rogath about the art gallery’s potential challenge to the authenticity of the painting. If Siebenmann told Rogath about the potential challenge before Rogath entered into the sale contract, Rogath cannot now maintain a claim for breach of the contradictory warranty in the contract. The district court’s order granting Rogath summary judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
