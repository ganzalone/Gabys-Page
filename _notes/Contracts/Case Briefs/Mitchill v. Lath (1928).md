# Mitchill v. Lath

Court of Appeals of New York

160 N.E. 646 (1928)

## Rule of Law

Under the parol evidence rule, written or oral evidence that contradicts a final written agreement is not admissible in a court of law unless it constitutes a parol collateral agreement that is completely distinct from and independent of the final written agreement.

## Facts

In 1923, Charles Lath (defendant) owned a farm. Across the road from the farm, on another person’s property, Lath owned an icehouse. In fall 1923, Lath contracted to sell the farm to Catherine C. Mitchill (plaintiff) for $8,400. Mitchill, however, found the icehouse objectionable and requested Lath remove it. In addition to the written agreement executed by the parties for the sale of Lath’s farm, Lath also orally agreed to remove the icehouse in the spring of 1924. After Mitchill took possession of the farm, Lath refused to remove the icehouse. Mitchill brought suit for specific performance of the oral agreement, and the trial court ruled in her favor. The appellate court affirmed, and Lath appealed.

## Issue

Whether written or oral evidence that constitutes a parol collateral agreement distinct from and independent of a final written agreement is admissible in a court of law.

## Holding and Reasoning (Andrews, J.)

Yes. Evidence of the alleged oral agreement between Mitchell and Lath regarding removal of the icehouse is not independent and distinct from the final agreement to sell Lath’s property to Mitchill and is thus inadmissible. Under the parol evidence rule, written or oral evidence that contradicts a final written agreement is not admissible in a court of law unless it constitutes a parol collateral agreement that is completely distinct from and independent of the final written agreement. Three conditions must be satisfied before an oral agreement may be admitted to vary the terms of a final written agreement: the oral agreement must be truly collateral (distinct and independent from the written agreement) in form; the oral agreement must not contradict express or implied provisions of the written contract; and the oral agreement must be one that parties would not ordinarily be expected to embody in a written agreement, based on an examination of the circumstances surrounding the drafting of the written agreement. The oral agreement between Lath and Mitchill fails the third condition in that nothing in the circumstances surrounding their contract for the sale of Lath’s farm suggests that it is natural for a completely separate contract to exist for the removal of the icehouse. On the contrary, the final written agreement is extremely detailed and by all appearance seems complete. If such a provision requiring Lath to remove the icehouse exists, one would naturally expect to find it in the written agreement due to the comprehensive nature of the writing. The closeness of subject matter of the written and oral contracts (Lath’s farm and Lath’s icehouse across from the farm) suggests that any oral contract governing removal of the icehouse is not truly collateral to the contract for the sale of the farm, and is thus inadmissible in a court of law. 

## Judgement:
The decision of the lower courts ordering specific performance for Mitchill is reversed.
