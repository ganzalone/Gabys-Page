# Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co.

Supreme Court of California

69 Cal.2d 33, 442 P.2d 641 (1968)

## Rule of Law

If a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intent of the parties still leaves contractual terms fairly susceptible to at least two rational interpretations, extrinsic evidence relevant to prove either of these meanings is admissible.

## Facts

In 1960, G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co. (Thomas) (defendant) entered into a contract with Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E) to provide labor and equipment necessary to remove and replace the upper cover for PG&E’s steam turbine. Thomas agreed to perform the work at its own risk and expense and to indemnify PG&E for any “loss, damage, expense and liability resulting from injury to property” or any other act associated with performance of the contract. During performance, the cover fell and damaged part of the exposed rotor of PG&E’s turbine. PG&E brought suit to recover $25,144.51 in damages. The trial court awarded judgment for PG&E on the ground that Thomas’ indemnity provision protected PG&E from damage to its own property. The trial court concluded that the “plain meaning” of the indemnity provision in Thomas’ contract was to permit indemnification of damage to PG&E’s property in addition to the property of third parties. The trial court admitted no extrinsic evidence on this issue. Thomas appealed, arguing that the extrinsic evidence should be admissible to show that the “plain meaning” of the indemnity clause was that it should only apply to damage of the property of third parties, not PG&E.

## Issue

Whether extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove the meaning of contractual terms when the intent of the parties to the contract is ambiguous.

## Holding and Reasoning (Traynor, C.J.)

Yes. The trial court erred in refusing to admit extrinsic evidence on the issue of the plain meaning of Thomas’ indemnity provision. If a preliminary consideration of all credible evidence offered to prove the intent of the parties still leaves contractual terms fairly susceptible to at least two rational interpretations, extrinsic evidence relevant to prove either of these meanings is admissible. The meaning of words used in a contract varies immensely based on the verbal context and surrounding circumstances associated with contract formation, as well as the linguistic education and experience of their users and readers. This includes the linguistic education and experience of judges. However, judges act improperly when they refuse to consider extrinsic evidence relevant to show the intent of the parties in drafting contract language, as no contractual rights or obligations are formed minus the intent of the parties. Thus, instead of relying on its own interpretation of the “plain meaning” of Thomas’ indemnity clause, the trial court should have examined the contract language itself and any credible extrinsic evidence relevant to ascertaining the intent of the parties surrounding that language. The decision of the trial court is reversed.
