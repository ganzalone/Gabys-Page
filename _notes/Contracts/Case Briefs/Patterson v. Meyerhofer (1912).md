# Patterson v. Meyerhofer

New York Court of Appeals

97 N.E. 472 (1912)

##### pg 719


## Rule of Law

The parties to any contract impliedly promise that they will not intentionally or purposefully prevent one another from carrying out the agreement.

## Facts

Benjamin Patterson (plaintiff) agreed to sell four properties to Anna Meyerhofer (defendant). 

- Meyerhofer knew that Patterson did not yet own the properties but intended to purchase them at an upcoming foreclosure sale. 
- Later, however, Meyerhofer told Patterson that she would not uphold her end of the bargain. Instead, Meyerhofer attended the foreclosure sale and outbid Patterson on all four properties. Meyerhofer paid $620 less than the total contract price. Meyerhofer also purchased a fifth house, which Patterson alleged was the subject of a parol agreement. 
- 
- According to Patterson, if he was able to buy all five properties, he and Meyerhofer agreed he would keep the fifth for himself. 
- 
- Patterson sued for $620 in damages and demanded that Meyerhofer convey the fifth house to him. The trial judge concluded that there was “no relation of trust” between the parties and that Meyerhofer was free to buy the properties at the sale. The judge also found no parol agreement. The Appellate Division affirmed. Patterson appealed to the Court of Appeals of New York.

## Issue

May a party who intentionally causes the other party to breach a contract be held liable under the contract?

## Holding and Reasoning (Bartlett, J.)

Yes. The parties to any contract impliedly promise that they will not purposely prevent one another from carrying out the agreement. This is the logical next step from the general rule barring a party who causes another to breach from recovering damages for nonperformance. Likewise, the party who causes the breach may not raise the breach as a defense for her own nonperformance. In this case, Meyerhofer knew Patterson had not yet acquired the properties and impliedly agreed that she would do nothing to prevent from doing so when she entered into the contract. Meyerhofer thus violated that obligation by purchasing the properties herself. It is fair to assume Patterson would have been able to buy the properties for the price Meyerhofer paid. Thus, Meyerhofer is liable for the $620 difference between the price she paid and the contract price. There was no evidence of the parol agreement regarding the fifth house, and such an agreement likely would not have been enforceable. The judgment is reversed.
