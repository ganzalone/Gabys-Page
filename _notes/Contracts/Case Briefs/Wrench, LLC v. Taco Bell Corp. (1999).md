Defendant(s): Taco Bell Corp

### Procedural history: 
US District Court for Western District of Michigan- granted summary of judgement to defendant- plaintiff appeals- goes to sixth circuit court

### Issue: 
Had an implied contract been created? Did Taco Bell break it?

### Facts: 
Thomas Ranks and Joseph Shields develop “Psycho Chihuahua” in early 1995 at Wrench, LLC (Plaintiff). Ed Alfaro, creative director for Taco Bell Corp. (Defendant), asks for materials on character. Wrench hires a strategy licensing firm to handle negotiations. Taco Bell does not respond to proposal, however Alfaro continues to negotiate, continuing to pass information to other agency. 1997 Taco Bell releases ad with Chihuahua with a different advertising agency. Wrench sues Taco Bell.

### Rule of law:

### Analysis:

### Holding:
judgement reversed

### Judgement:

### Rationale:
claim was not preempted by the federal copyright act & plaintiff has already established enough evidence to maintain a breach of implied contract claim. Taco Bell concedes.
