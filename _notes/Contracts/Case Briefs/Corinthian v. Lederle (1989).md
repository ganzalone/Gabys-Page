Lederle sells vaccines to Corinthian. Lederle raises prices. Corinthian places an order for 1,000 Vehicles before new price sets in the day before. Lederle sends 50 vials for a lower price and sends the next 954 the new price. Corinthians sues over specific performance. Corinthian only received a tracking number, which is not specific enough and cannot be associated with substance. Cannot constitute acceptance. 

Under the UCC unless otherwise unambiguously indicated, an offer can be construed as inviting acceptance of either conforming or non-conforming goods. Selling of non-conforming does not constitute acceptance *you need notificationÂ
