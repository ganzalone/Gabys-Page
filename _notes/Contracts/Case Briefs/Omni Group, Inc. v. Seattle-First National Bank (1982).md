## Rule of Law

Where a party’s judgment on some issue is a condition precedent to his promise, the judgment must be made in good faith and that duty to act in good faith is sufficient consideration to make the promise valid.

## Facts

John Clark (defendant) executed an agency agreement under which Royal Realty (Royal) would sell his property. Subsequently, Royal entered into an agreement with Omni Group (Omni) (plaintiff) under which Omni agreed to buy the property, subject to a satisfactory engineer and architect’s feasibility report. Such a report was to indicate the suitability of the land for development. Omni then decided to forego the report requirement and accepted all terms in the contract. However, Clark refused to proceed with the sale and Omni brought suit. The trial court ruled in favor of Clark, finding that Omni’s promise to buy the property was illusory due to the report being a condition precedent. Omni appealed. Seattle-First National Bank (Bank) (defendant) took over as respondent as executor of Clark’s estate after he died.

## Issue

Does a party’s judgment on some issue as a condition of its promise invalidate the enforceability of the promise as illusory?

## Holding and Reasoning (James, J.)

No. A promise that is dependent upon a condition precedent does not necessarily make the promise illusory or invalidate it as consideration. This is true even if
- the condition precedent is a party’s “personal satisfaction with the quality of the performance for which he has bargained” as long as the party’s determination that he is satisfied is made in good faith. 

- That duty of good faith constitutes adequate consideration supporting the party’s promise, so the promise is enforceable and not illusory. In the case at bar, Omni’s promise to buy the property is not illusory and is enforceable against the Bank even though it was conditioned on Omni being satisfied with a feasibility report. As an initial matter, this is a reasonable condition because a party needs to be sure that it is getting what it is bargaining for. Further, although the condition is a subjective judgment, as long as such judgment is made in good faith, it is sufficient to support the promise as consideration. It is not necessary to determine if the judgment is made in good faith in this case because Omni decided to forego the condition. The duty to act in good faith alone made the promise enforceable. Accordingly, the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to order specific performance of the contract.
