Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division

400 A.2d 78 (1979)

## Rule of Law

Where parties enter a contract and are under a mistake regarding a fact that forms the basis for the transaction, the contract is voidable by either party if enforcement of the contract would be materially more difficult than it would have been had the fact been as the parties believed it to be.

## Facts

Beachcomber Coins, Inc. (Beachcomber) (plaintiff) is a retailer of coins. Beachcomber contracted to purchase a rare dime for $500.00 from Boskett (defendant), a coin dealer. Both Beachcomber and Boskett believed the dime to be minted in 1916 in Denver. Beachcomber paid Boskett for the coin, and received an offer to resell the coin for $700.00. The buyer conditioned the purchase, however, on a favorable inspection of the coin and determination of its rarity by the American Numismatic Society. That organization inspected the coin and determined it was counterfeit. As a result, Beachcomber brought an action in New Jersey state court against Boskett seeking to rescind the contract due to mutual mistake of fact. The trial court held for Boskett on the ground that it was customary within the trade for a retailer purchasing a coin to conduct its own investigation of the genuineness of the coin and to “assume the risk” of his purchase if his investigation is faulty. Thus, the trial court held that Beachcomber’s failure to conduct such an investigation resulted in its assumption of the risk that the coin was less than genuine. Beachcomber appealed.

## Issue

Where parties enter a contract and are under a mistake regarding a fact that forms the basis for the transaction, is the contract voidable by either party if enforcement of the contract would be materially more difficult than it would have been had the fact been as the parties believed it to be?

## Holding and Reasoning (Conford, J.)

Yes. Beachcomber may rescind the contract with Boskett due to a mutual mistake of fact. Where parties enter a contract and are under a mistake regarding a fact that forms the basis for the transaction, the contract is voidable by either party if enforcement of the contract would be materially more difficult than it would have been had the fact been as the parties believed it to be. Even if a party is negligent in failing to know or to discover the facts as to which both parties are under a mistake, the party may still seek to rescind the contract based on mutual mistake of fact. Rescission of the contract due to mutual mistake is not appropriate, however, when one or both parties assume the risk of a mistake. A party “assumes the risk” of a mistake when the party knows that there is doubt in regard to a certain matter and contracts based on that assumption. This rule only applies when the parties are conscious that the pertinent fact upon which a contract is based may not be true and make their agreement at the risk of that possibility. Both Beachcomber and Boskett believed the dime had been minted in 1916 in Denver and thus was rare. This was a mutual mistake of fact regarding the basis of the transaction. Enforcement of the transaction would have resulted in significantly greater hardship for Beachcomber than if the coin had actually been real. Thus, Beachcomber is entitled to rescission unless it can be determined from the evidence that Beachcomber “assumed the risk” of the transaction. There is no evidence that Beachcomber suspected that the coin might not be real, and thus assumed the risk. Additionally, the evidence submitted at trial that the industry custom is for a retailer to make an independent inspection of the coin and assume the risk that the investigation is faulty is insufficient. It cannot be concluded from the evidence that Beachcomber acted contrary to any prevailing industry standards or customs. Thus, Beachcomber cannot be held to have assumed the risk that the coin was less than genuine. Beachcomber may rescind the contract with Boskett due to a mutual mistake of fact. The decision of the trial court is reversed.**
