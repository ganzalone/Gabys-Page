### Textile Unlimited, Inc. v. A..BMH and Company, Inc.

*United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit

*240 F.3d 781 (2001)*

## Facts

Over a period of ten months, Textile Unlimited, Inc. (Textile) (plaintiff) purchased yarn on thirty-eight separate occasions from A..BMH and Company, Inc. (BMH) (defendant). Each time, Textile sent a purchase order to a broker containing the date, item number, item description, quantity ordered, and price. BMH always responded with an invoice, followed by shipment of the yarn and an order acknowledgement. The order acknowledgement always contained additional terms not included in Textile’s purchase orders. These terms provided that any disputes would be resolved by arbitration in Atlanta, Georgia, under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. BMH also included a provision in the fine print stating that Textile was “deemed to have accepted these terms in full” if Textile did not respond within 24 hours. Textile did not respond within 24 hours of receiving any of BMH’s order acknowledgements. In September 1998, Textile refused to pay for a shipment of yarn from BMH because the yarn was defective. BMH submitted the dispute to arbitration in Georgia. Textile objected to the arbitration on the ground that the BMH’s arbitration clause was not part of the contract between Textile and BMH. 

## Procedure: 
Textile filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California to enjoin the arbitration. The district court held for Textile and preliminarily enjoined the pending arbitration. BMH appealed.

## Issue

Whether, in a contract implied by conduct under Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) §2-207(3), the additional terms upon which the parties do not agree will drop out of the contract, and the missing terms will be supplied by the UCC.

## Holding and Reasoning (Thomas, J.)

Yes. Textile never gave specific and unequivocal consent to BMH’s arbitration clause, and although a contract is implied from the parties’ conduct under UCC §2-207(3), the arbitration clause is not included in the final terms of the contract. When a contract may be implied by conduct under Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) §2-207(3), the additional terms upon which the parties do not agree will drop out of the contract, and the missing terms will be supplied by the UCC. UCC §2-207(3) is used to imply a contract from conduct when no contract is created under UCC §2-207(1). UCC §2-207(1) provides that an acceptance will operate to create a contract even if additional or different terms are stated unless the acceptance is expressly conditioned on assent to the new terms. To qualify as an acceptance under §2-207(1), an offeror must give “specific and unequivocal consent” to any supplemental terms. If no such consent is given, no contract is formed under §2-207(1). If a contract does exist at all, it is only because it is implied from the parties’ conduct under §2-207(3). When BMH sent its order acknowledgements containing the arbitration clause in question, it provided that Textile would be deemed to have accepted the terms in full if it did not respond within 24 hours. Textile’s lack of response within 24 hours, however, does not constitute “specific and unequivocal consent” to the arbitration clause term. Textile never provided specific and unequivocal consent to the new arbitration clause, and thus under UCC §2-207(1), no contract was formed between BMH and Textile containing this term. Both Textile and BMH admit, however, to originally forming a contract by their actions of buying and selling yarn. Their conduct implies the existence of a contract under §2-207(3). According to UCC §2-207(3), if a contract is formed by conduct, only the original terms agreed upon by the parties will be incorporated into the contract. The disputed terms will drop out, and any missing terms will be supplied by the UCC. The parties never agreed upon the arbitration clause, as Textile never gave specific and unequivocal consent to this term. Thus, under UCC §2-207(3), this term drops out of the implied contract. There is no generic, “gap-filling” arbitration term provided in the UCC, and thus no arbitration clause is incorporated into the contract. BMH’s arbitration provision is unenforceable against Textile.

## Judgement:
The decision of the district court is affirmed.
