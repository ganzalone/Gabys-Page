## Rule of Law

If a contracting party discloses partial information that may be misleading, that party has a duty to reveal all the material facts it knows to avoid liability for deceiving the other party.

## Facts

V.S.H. Realty, Inc. (V.S.H.) (plaintiff) contracted to purchase a bulk storage petroleum facility from Texaco, Inc. (Texaco) (defendant). V.S.H. agreed to purchase the property “as is.” During negotiations, V.S.H. repeatedly asked Texaco about oil leakage on the property. In the sales contract, Texaco disclosed oil seepage in the boiler room of the facility. Approximately one month after the parties signed the contract, V.S.H. representatives were on the property and noticed oil seepage on multiple additional parts of the property. When Texaco refused to return V.S.H.’s down payment, V.S.H. brought suit for common law misrepresentation and violation of a Massachusetts statute prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices. The district court dismissed V.S.H.’s claims. V.S.H. appealed.

## Issue

If a contracting party discloses partial information that may be misleading, does that party have a duty to reveal all the material facts it knows to avoid liability for deceiving the other party?

## Holding and Reasoning (Coffin, J.)

Yes. If a contracting party discloses partial information that may be misleading, that party has a duty to reveal all the material facts it knows to avoid liability for deceiving the other party. In common law misrepresentation, the duty to disclose fully arises upon partial disclosure. Under the Massachusetts statute, a deceptive-practices claim can be cognizable even without establishment of a duty to disclose. Notably, an “as is” clause in the contract is not, as a matter of law, a defense to claims of fraud or deceptive conduct. In this case, the district court erred in dismissing V.S.H.’s misrepresentation and deceptive-practices claims. Under common law misrepresentation, Texaco’s partial disclosure of oil seepage in response to V.S.H.’s repeated requests for such information established a duty to disclose all the material facts Texaco knew about the oil seepage. Further, under the Massachusetts statute, establishment of such a duty is not required to bring a deceptive-practices claim for failure to disclose. V.S.H.’s claim that Texaco knew of and failed to disclose the oil seepage in the other parts of the property is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded.
