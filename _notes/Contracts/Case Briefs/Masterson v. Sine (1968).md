# Masterson v. Sine

Supreme Court of California

436 P.2d 561 (1968)

## Rule of Law

Even when it is unclear whether a written contract is intended by the parties to be complete, evidence of a separate oral agreement may be admissible to prove the terms of the contract if the oral agreement is something that would naturally be made as a separate agreement by the parties given their actual situation and circumstances when drafting the written contract.

## Facts

Dallas Masterson and his wife Rebecca Masterson (plaintiff) owned a ranch as tenants in common. On February 25, 1958, they conveyed the ranch to Medora and Lu Sine (defendants) through a grant deed which reserved the option for the grantors to purchase the property back within ten years of the date of conveyance. The deed stated that the Mastersons could exercise this option by paying the same amount of consideration as was provided by the Sines, minus any depreciation in the value of the property. Medora Sine is Dallas Masterson’s sister and the wife of Lu Sine. After the conveyance, Dallas declared bankruptcy, and a bankruptcy trustee took over his estate. The trustee and Rebecca Masterson brought a declaratory relief action to establish their right to enforce the option to repurchase the property conveyed to the Sines. At trial, the trial court admitted extrinsic evidence showing that the “consideration” mentioned in the agreement was $50,000, and that any “deprecation in value” referred to depreciation allowable under income tax laws. However, the trial court also held that the parol evidence rule prohibited introduction of evidence offered by the Sines that the parties intended the property to be kept within the Masterson family and thus that the option was personal to the Mastersons and could not be exercised by the bankruptcy trustee. Both parties appealed.

## Issue

Whether evidence of a separate oral agreement is admissible to prove the terms of a written contract when it is unclear whether the written contract is intended by the parties to be complete.

## Holding and Reasoning (Traynor, C.J.)

Yes. The trial court correctly admitted extrinsic evidence providing the amount of consideration and definition of depreciation contemplated by the parties in the written contract, but erred in excluding evidence of an oral agreement between the parties that the option was intended to be kept within the Masterson family and thus personal to the grantors. Even when it is unclear whether a written contract is intended by the parties to be complete, evidence of a separate oral agreement may be admissible to prove the terms of the contract if the oral agreement is something that would naturally be made as a separate agreement by the parties given their actual situation and circumstances when drafting the written contract. Generally, evidence of oral collateral agreements should always be admitted unless it is likely to mislead the trier of fact. The deed executed by the Mastersons is completely silent on its completeness and the question of assignability. However, because of the structured nature of a deed, it is unlikely that the deed itself incorporated all existing oral collateral agreements and it would be inappropriate for a court to assume as much. While many states have statutes preventing restrictions on the assignability of options, California has no such statute. Thus, no overriding statutory provision prohibits the introduction of an oral collateral agreement showing that the parties intended to create a familial restriction on the assignability of the grantors’ option to repurchase. Given these particular factual circumstances, the trial court should have admitted evidence offered by the Sines that the parties agreed that the option was not assignable in order to keep the property within the Masterson family. 

## Judgement:
The decision of the trial court is reversed.
