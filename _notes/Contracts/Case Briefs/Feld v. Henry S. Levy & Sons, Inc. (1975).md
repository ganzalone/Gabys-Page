## Rule of Law

In an output contract for the sale of goods, the quantity of output is such actual output as occurs in good faith based on the seller’s best efforts to supply the goods.

## Facts

A wholesale bread-baking business (defendant) entered into a contract to sell Fred Feld (plaintiff) all the bread crumbs the wholesaler produced for a period of one year. Before the year was up, the wholesaler stopped producing bread crumbs because the process was “very uneconomical” due to the nature of the production equipment. However, no steps were taken to obtain equipment that made the process more economical.


## Procedure
- Feld brought suit and moved for summary judgment. The wholesaler also moved for summary judgment to dismiss the claim. The trial court denied both motions, and the appellate court affirmed. Both parties appealed.

## Issue

Does an output contract for the sale of goods require that the seller continue producing the goods until the end of the contract unconditionally?

## Holding and Reasoning (Cooke, J.)

No. In an output contract for the sale of goods, the quantity of output is such actual output as occurs in good faith based on the seller’s best efforts to supply the goods. Thus, the seller must continue producing the goods in good faith, until it determines in good faith that it will sustain losses that are “more than trivial” if production continues. The question of whether a party performs and ceases performance in good faith is a question of fact. Here, although the wholesaler claimed that its production of bread crumbs was not economical, it is not clear whether the wholesaler exercised good faith in that determination, and it is not clear if “very uneconomical” means that the wholesaler sustained substantial losses due to the continued production. These are questions of fact that are not determinable on the record. Consequently, denial of both parties’ motions for summary judgment was correct. The lower courts are affirmed.
