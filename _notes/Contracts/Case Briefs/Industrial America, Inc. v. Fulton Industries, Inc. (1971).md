Created: 2022-08-28 11:43

### Casebook date, page number
*citation*

Plaintiff(s): Industrial America, Inc. (Industrial)
Defendant(s): Fulton Industries, Inc.

### Procedural history:
Industrial brought suit against Bush Hog and Fulton in Delaware state court. The trial court awarded Industrial its $125,000 broker’s commission against B-H. Industrial was unsuccessful in obtaining a judgment against Fulton. The trial court held that Industrial had never accepted Fulton’s “offer” in its advertisement- . Industrial appealed.

### Issue:
When an offeror requests an act in return for his promise and the offeree fully performs the act, does this full performance constitute sufficient acceptance of the offer to form a binding contract?

### Facts:
Industrial America, Inc. (Industrial) (plaintiff) was a broker specializing in the sale or merger of businesses. Bush Hog, Inc. was a farm machinery company wanting to be in a merger with another business. Bush Hog hired Industrial to help with the merger. Industrial approached two companies about the merger. Following unsuccessful negotiations, Bush Hog decided to no longer work with Industrial, but did not communicate this to Industrial. In fall 1965, Industrial saw an advertisement placed in the newspaper by Fulton Industries, Inc. Fulton (Defendant) was seeking a merger with another business, and said that all brokers would be fully protected. On October 7, 1965, Industrial contacted Fulton and provided details about Bush Hog and its desire for a merger. Fulton responded that it was very much interested in Bush Hog, and asked Industrial to arrange a meeting between Fulton and Bush Hog. Industrial contacted Bush Hog and shared Fulton’s interest in the merger. Fulton’s president then independently contracted Bush Hog and set up a meeting on November 4, 1965. Industrial was unaware of this meeting until it called Bush Hog on November 3, 1965 to inquire about its failure to respond to Industrial’s offers to assist with the Fulton merger. Despite Industrial’s repeated offers to assist with the merger, neither Fulton nor Bush Hog communicated further with Industrial. Bush Hog and Fulton continued negotiations with each other until March 11, 1966, when they completed their merger. 

### Rule of law:

### Analysis:

### Holding:
Yes., full performance constitutes acceptance to form a contract.

### Judgement:

### Rationale:
Industrial fully performed the requested act in Fulton’s offer and is entitled to a broker’s commission from Fulton. When an offeror requests an act in return for his promise and the offeree fully performs the act, this full performance constitutes sufficient acceptance of the offer to form a binding contract.
