# Centronics Corporation v. Genicom Corporation

Supreme Court of New Hampshire

*562 A.2d 187 (1989)*

#### casebook pg 709

## Rule of Law

Under an agreement that either expressly or impliedly vests one party with a degree of discretion in performance sufficient to deprive another party of a substantial proportion of the agreement’s value, the parties’ intent to be bound by an enforceable contract raises an implied obligation of good faith to observe reasonable limits in exercising that discretion, consistent with the parties’ purposes for contracting.

## Facts

Centronics Corporation (Centronics) (plaintiff) contracted to sell business assets to Genicom Corporation (Genicom) (defendant). 

- The contract required an escrow deposit by Genicom of the funds needed to fulfill the contract. 
- The contract stated that the funds would be held by an escrow agent and would not be dispersed until the escrow agent received instruction from counsels for Centronics and Genicom. The contract also contained a provision requiring any disputes over the value of the property to be submitted to arbitration. 
- Centronics and Genicom disputed the value of the property, and the matter was submitted to arbitration. While arbitration was pending, Centronics demanded a partial payment from the escrow funds of monies that were not in dispute.
- Genicom refused to release payment, arguing that the contract provided that the escrow agent should not release the funds until the completion of arbitration. 

## Procedure: 
Centronics brought suit against Genicom in New Hampshire state court, alleging Genicom’s failure to authorize a partial payment of the funds before arbitration violated an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in the contract. The trial court held that because the contract contained no such provision requiring the partial payment of funds pending arbitration, Genicom did not violate a duty of good faith. Centronics appealed.

## Issue

Under an agreement that either expressly or impliedly vests one party with a degree of discretion in performance sufficient to deprive another party of a substantial proportion of the agreement’s value, does the parties’ intent to be bound by an enforceable contract raise an implied obligation of good faith to observe reasonable limits in exercising that discretion, consistent with the parties’ purposes for contracting?

## Holding and Reasoning (Souter, J.)

Yes. Genicom did not violate an implied duty of good faith in the contract by refusing to release a partial payment of funds because the contract contained no such requirement. Under an agreement that either expressly or impliedly vests one party with a degree of discretion in performance sufficient to deprive another party of a substantial proportion of the agreement’s value, the parties’ intent to be bound by an enforceable contract raises an implied obligation of good faith to observe reasonable limits in exercising that discretion, consistent with the parties’ purposes for contracting. Whether an implied obligation of good faith to observe reasonable limits in exercising discretion exists depends on several factors. 

- First, the agreement itself must allow one party a degree of discretion in performance amounting to a power to deprive the other party of a substantial proportion of the agreement’s value. 
- Second, if the discretion allowed in the agreement amounts to such a power, the evidence must indicate that the parties intended by their agreement to make a legally enforceable contract. 
- Third, if the parties intended to be bound by a legally enforceable contract, the party exercising its discretion to deprive the other party of a substantial proportion of value must have acted unreasonably in doing so. 
- Finally, any damage caused must have been directly related to the party’s abuse of discretion and must not have been caused by events beyond the control of either party. 

Applying this analysis to the present case, Centronics’ argument fails to satisfy the first factor. There is no evidence that the agreement between Centronics and Genicom provides Genicom with any type of discretion of performance that would deny Centronics a substantial proportion of the agreement’s value. The contract expressly provides that final payment of the escrow amount must be paid within ten days after final resolution of the purchase price. Since the dispute over the purchase price has been submitted to arbitration, the contract requires final payment to be made ten days after arbitration concludes. These terms grant no discretion to Genicom to delay disbursement of funds, and thus the agreement contains no implied obligation for Genicom to act in good faith when exercising such discretion. Since Genicom has no discretion, Centronics’ argument that Genicom violated its duty of good faith to refrain from delaying disbursement fails. Centronics is effectively seeking to have the court modify the agreement to include an implied obligation of Genicom to consent to partial payment in the event of arbitration. The agreement itself contains no such provision, and the court will not modify the agreement to contain such a requirement. Genicom did not violate an implied duty of good faith in the contract by refusing to release a partial payment of funds because the contract contained no such requirement. 

### Decision: 
The decision of the trial court is affirmed.
