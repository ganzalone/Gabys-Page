# Morris Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store (1957)
Created: 2022-08-28 11:33

#### Supreme Court of Minnesota 1957

251 Minn 188

Plaintiff(s):
Defendant(s):

### Procedural history:
Municipal court, Lefkowitz asks for damages minus sales price. Store says it was a unilateral offer to be withdrawn at any time and/or invite potential buyers to make the store an offer. Lefkowitz wins the price of the stole as it was specified but it is appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court. 

### Issue:
 Does a clear cut ad with no negotiation terms constitute an offer?

### Facts:
 Surplus store puts out an ad “3 fur coats worth up to $100 for $1 each” Lefkowitz appears first customer on sat 9 am but is told it is for women only. Same thing happened the following weekend with an ad for rabbit fur stoles. Lefkowitz sued for breach of contract. 


### Rule of law:
*Ads become binding upon acceptance*

### Analysis:

### Holding:
Yes

### Judgement:

### Rationale:
 If something is clear, definite, explicit, and nothing is open for negotiation, then it is an offer.

Was accepted before oral modification of house rules (women only rule)
