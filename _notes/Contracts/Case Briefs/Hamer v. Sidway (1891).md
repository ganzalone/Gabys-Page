## Rule of Law:

A party's agreement to incur a detriment constitutes adequate consideration.

## Facts:

Louisa Hamer (plaintiff) received several assignments of $5,000 and interest from William E. Story II (Story). Story made the assignments based on money he was to receive from his uncle, William E. Story, Sr. Several years previously, Story’s uncle promised him that if he would abstain from “drinking, using tobaccos, swearing, and playing cards or billiards for money” until he reached 21 years of age, he would be paid $5,000 UNCLE WAS ASKING FOR AN ACT, OR A PERFORMANCE. SPECIFICALLY ASKING TO RELINQUISH FREEDOM TO DO XYZ DETRIMENT TO THE PROMISEE 

RECIPROCAL RELATION COMMENT B §71 . Story agreed and fully honored the promise by abstaining from these things until after his twenty-first birthday. At that time, Story wrote to his uncle and informed him that he had upheld his promise. His uncle wrote back and said that he was entitled to the $5,000 and that the money was being held for him at a bank. However, Story’s uncle said that it would not be paid to him until he felt Story was capable of “taking care of it.” Story agreed, and the money remained at the bank. Story’s uncle died without paying him the money

## Procedure:
claim was brought by Hamer to Franklin Sidway (defendant), the executor of Story’s uncle’s estate. The executor rejected the claim, and Hamer brought suit in New York state court seeking to enforce the promise to Story. The trial court upheld the promise, but the appellate court reversed. Hamer appealed to the New York Court of Appeals.

## Issue:

Does a party's agreement to incur a detriment constitute adequate consideration?

## Holding and Reasoning (Parker, J.):

Yes. A party's agreement to incur a detriment constitutes adequate consideration. Adequate consideration sufficient to form a valid and enforceable contract may consist of either a right, interest, profit, or benefit accrued to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility given, suffered, or undertaken by the other. It does not matter whether one party actually received a benefit or whether the thing that forms the consideration is of any substantial value to either party. Adequate consideration does not depend so much on a promisor’s benefit from a contract as it does on the promisee’s voluntary limitation of his legal rights or freedoms in exchange for the promise. In this case, in exchange for his uncle’s promise of $5,000, Story voluntarily restricted his legal freedom to engage in drinking, smoking, swearing, and gambling. It is irrelevant whether his uncle actually received any benefit from Story’s actions. Story’s voluntary agreement to incur these limitations constitutes adequate consideration to form a valid and enforceable contract with his uncle. 

## Judgement: 
The decision of the appellate court is reversed, and the decision of the trial court is affirmed.
