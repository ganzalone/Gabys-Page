### Supreme Court of Oregon, 1978

284 Or. 361

Plaintiff(s): Southworth
Defendant(s): Oliver & wife

### Procedural history:
Southworth sues in trial court claiming contract with specific performance, Oliver loses and appeals. Brought to Supreme Court of Oregon

### Issue:
Can reasonably interpreted words be considered an offer even if not intended to be? 

### Facts: 
Joseph Oliver and his wife decide to sell  a portion of their ranch. May 1976 Oliver visits Southworth who is interested, Oliver says he will set the terms while Southworth arranges financing. Simultaneously, Oliver discusses grazing permits with a Mr. Holiday, who is also interested in purchasing some land. June 13, Southworth asks Oliver if he is still selling. Oliver says yes and that he is waiting on an assessor. Dated June 17th Oliver writes selling 2,933 acres for $324,419 29% down payment & other terms, sent to Southworth and 3 other people. Southworth replies with acceptance however Oliver says the letter is not an acceptance but beginnings of negotiation with all interested parties. Southworth sues. 

### Rule of law:

### Analysis:

### Holding:
even if not intended, can be enforced

### Judgement:

### Rationale:
Acts and words considered, price quotation is not itself an offer, however with supplementals can constitute an enforceable offer. Oliver’s conversations with specific terms (examples being language, specific party addressed, definity of proposal) were enough to constitute an offer.
