## Facts: 

Mills (defendant) was a family portrait business that used telemarketing to attract clients. Telemarketer called Allen Schreiber (plaintiff) to seek his business. In response, Schreiber sent a letter to Olan Mills stating that he was not interested in becoming a client, and that Olan Mills should stop calling. The letter stated that if Olan Mills called again, Schreiber would consider Olan Mills to have entered into a contract for Schreiber’s “listening services.” The letter stated that Schreiber’s rate for listening was $100 per hour. After Schreiber sent the letter, he received two telemarketing phone calls from Olan Mills, for which he billed Olan Mills $479 for his listening services. Olan Mills did not pay, and Schreiber brought suit for breach of contract. The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding that as a matter of law a contract had not been established. Schreiber appealed.

## Issue

To establish a contract, must there be a meeting of the minds such that the parties mutually assent to the same thing?

## Holding and Reasoning (Popovich, J.)

Yes. To establish a contract, there must be a meeting of the minds such that the parties mutually assent to the same thing. Assent can be manifested by either words or conduct. Mills did not manifest its assent to contract for Schreiber’s listening services. The judgment of the trial court dismissing Schreiber’s complaint is affirmed.

REVOCATION- anything that manifests to the other side that they have no intention of entering into the proposed agreement. (unless its an option contract)
