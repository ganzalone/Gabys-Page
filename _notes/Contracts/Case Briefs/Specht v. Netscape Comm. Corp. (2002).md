## Rule of Law

An offeree, regardless of apparent manifestation of his consent, is not bound by or charged with having inquiry notice of inconspicuous contractual provisions of which he is unaware, displayed in a format that would not be obvious as contractual to a reasonably prudent offeree.

If rejection sent, acceptance can still be valid if received before rejection

Acceptance sent first, followed by revocation of acceptance

## Facts

Netscape Communications Corp. (Netscape) provided two separate software programs known as “Communicator” and “SmartDownload.” When internet users downloaded these programs, the programs tracked the users’ internet usage and displayed advertisements relevant to their usage. Before downloading Communicator, all users were required to view and accept a license spelling out these terms of use. The license automatically displayed on the computer screens of everyone who attempted to download Communicator. However, a similar license did not appear on the screens of those who attempted to download SmartDownload. Rather, users just saw a button that said “download” and invited them to click to download the program. A link to the license agreement for SmartDownload could be viewed by users who scrolled down their screens below the “download” button. However, this link was not automatically visible to users who did not scroll down. Both license agreements for Communicator and SmartDownload contained arbitration clauses. Five Netscape users (plaintiffs) all downloaded both Communicator and SmartDownload. They agreed to the license agreement for Communicator but were unaware of, and thus did not agree to, the license agreement for SmartDownload. If they had clicked on the license link for SmartDownload, they would have been presented with a screen telling them that by downloading the product, they were agreeing to be bound by the terms of the license agreement. The five Netscape users and a website operator named Christopher Specht (plaintiffs) brought suit against Netscape in federal district court on the ground that the SmartDownload software was a violation of privacy and electronic “eavesdropping” statutes. Netscape moved to compel arbitration under the terms of the license agreements. The Netscape users argued that they should not be bound by the arbitration clause for the SmartDownload contract because the license for that product was not visible to a reasonable internet user. The district court agreed and held that they were not bound by the SmartDownload license agreement. The court also said that even though the Netscape users had agreed to the Communicator license agreement, that agreement did not bind them to arbitrate their claims involving SmartDownload. Netscape appealed.

## Issue

Is an offeree charged with having inquiry notice of, and thus bound by, inconspicuous license terms displayed in a format that would not be obvious as contractual to a reasonably prudent offeree?

## Holding and Reasoning (Sotomayor, C.J.)

No. An offeree, regardless of apparent manifestation of his consent, is not bound by or charged with having inquiry notice of inconspicuous contractual provisions of which he is unaware, displayed in a format that would not be obvious as contractual to a reasonably prudent offeree. When actual notice is not available because the existence of a license agreement is not immediately obvious, internet users may still be charged with inquiry notice if a reasonably prudent offeree should know to look for the license agreement before accepting the offer. However, nothing about the SmartDownload process indicated that internet users should think to search for a license agreement. A mere reference to the existence of license terms on a “submerged screen,” when internet users are prompted only on the visible screen to download free software, does not create sufficient inquiry notice to a reasonably prudent offeree that clicking on the “download” button binds that offeree to the terms of the license. Additionally, these circumstances are distinguishable from the “shrinkwrap” license cases such as ProCD v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447 (1996), which hold that purchasers of software may be bound by license agreements not printed on the outside of software packaging. The software purchasers in ProCD were immediately made aware of the existence and terms of license agreements before using their software, and they had a reasonable opportunity to read the terms and accept or reject them. In contrast, nothing in the circumstances surrounding the download of SmartDownload would alert users of the existence of a license agreement and prompt them to read it. Thus, because of the unique circumstances of Netscape’s license-agreement placement, the Netscape-user plaintiffs are not bound to the terms of Netscape’s license agreements for SmartDownload. Additionally, they cannot be made to consent to arbitration based on their agreement to the licensing terms contained in Communicator, as Communicator is a completely separate product from SmartDownload. 

## Judgement:
The trial court's decision is affirmed.
