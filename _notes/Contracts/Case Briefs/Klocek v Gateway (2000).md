## Klocek v Gateway

  

## Rule of Law: 
Additional or different terms provided in the acceptance do not become terms of the contract unless acceptance is made expressly conditional upon acceptance of the additional terms or the non-merchant offeror expressly agrees to the additional terms.

## Facts: 
Klocek (plaintiff) ordered a computer from Gateway (defendant). Gateway included its Standard Terms in every shipment of a new computer. At the top of the first page of those terms Gateway informed the purchaser that keeping the computer beyond five days constituted acceptance of the terms and conditions. Included in the Standard Terms was an arbitration clause. Klocek and others filed suit in the United States District Court against Gateway and others regarding the purchase of Gateway computers. Gateway moved to dismiss, requesting that the arbitration clause be enforced.

AFTER RREADING TERM, OFFEREE HAS X NUMBER OF DAYS 

## Issue:

Is the purchaser of a good required to comply with terms that are added to the agreement through a form memorializing the agreement, where the form states that failure to return the goods constitutes acceptance?

## Holding and Reasoning (Vratil, J.):

No. Arbitration clauses are favored, but an arbitration clause must be valid in order for it to be enforced. Section 2-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is often said to apply when there is a “battle of the forms,” but will also apply to cases involving only one form. The official comment thereto states that this section will apply where an oral agreement is reached and one or both of the parties sends a form memorializing the agreement and adds additional or different terms. The buyer is typically the offeror in a sales transaction. An acceptance will be deemed a counter-offer only when the acceptance is made conditional upon the offeror’s consent to the additional or different terms. When the offeror is not a merchant, section 2-207 provides that additional terms in the acceptance do not become part of the agreement unless the offeror expressly agrees to them. In the current matter, section 2-207 applies even though Standard Terms included in the package was the only form involved in the transaction. The Standard Terms constitute Gateway’s acceptance of the offer. It is not a counter-offer because Gateway’s acceptance was not made conditional upon Klocek’s consent to the additional terms. Moreover, the additional terms in the Standard Terms are not enforceable because Klocek did not expressly agree to them. Klocek’s keeping the computer beyond five days was not sufficient to constitute express agreement to the additional terms. 

## Judgement:
Accordingly, Gateway’s motion to dismiss is overruled.
