Adams v. Lindsell

*High Court of Justice, King's Bench Division

*106 Eng.Rep. 250 (1818)* 

## Facts

On September 2, 1817, Lindsell (defendant), a dealer in wool, sent a letter to Adams (plaintiff), a manufacturer of wool, offering to sell Adams a certain amount of wool. The offer provided for acceptance by written notice sent through regular mail (“in course of post”). Lindsell expected to receive a response from Adams by September 7th. However, Lindsell sent the letter to the wrong address, and Adams did not receive the letter until September 5th. That evening, Adams wrote an acceptance of the offer and mailed it back to Lindsell. Lindsell received Adams’s acceptance on September 9th. However, because Lindsell had not received a response from Adams as expected on September 7th, Lindsell sold the wool it had originally offered to Adams to a third party on September 8th. Adams brought suit against Lindsell for breach of contract. 

## Procedure: 
The trial court held that Adams’s acceptance was valid when placed by Adams in the mail, and that any delay in receiving the acceptance was caused by Lindsell’s failure to send the initial offer to the correct address. The trial court entered judgment for Adams, and Lindsell moved for a new trial.

## Issue

When a written offer is proposed by an offeror via postal mail, is the offeree’s acceptance of the offer valid if mailed within the time frame specified within the offer, if the manner of acceptance is permitted by the offer?

## Holding and Reasoning (Ellenborough, LCJ)

Yes. When a written offer is proposed by an offeror via postal mail, the offeree’s acceptance of the offer is valid if mailed within the time frame specified within the offer, if the manner of acceptance is permitted by the offer. Adams’s acceptance of Lindsell’s offer was valid when placed in the mail by Adams with the proper postage, thus forming a binding contract. The motion for a new trial is denied.

## Rule of Law

MAILBOX RULE- does not apply to options contracts

The MailboxRule” Generally, an acceptance takes effect when it is communicated to the offeror and it is not difficult to determine when this has occurred if the parties are in each other’s presence or otherwise in instantaneous communication by phone or electronic means. However, when parties are not in instantaneous communication, i.e., corresponding by mail, there is a delay between the sending and receipt of acceptance. Often, it is critical to determine which of these two times constitutes the legally effective acceptance: is it the time of dispatch or that of receipt? When the contract is formed by correspondence, the mechanics of assent follow “the mailboxrule” from the celebrated case of Adams v. Lindsell.31 This rule holds that an acceptance is effective upon dispatch. The rationale is that the offeree should be able to 29 rely on the contract and be protected against a revocation by the offeror following dispatch of the acceptance. At this time, the offeror’s power to revoke is terminated and the offeror is bound, even though the offeror does not know that the offer has been accepted. Of course the offeror, as master of the offer, can depart from the mailboxrule by providing otherwise in the offer. Upon dispatch, the mailboxrule also binds the offeree to the acceptance and it now becomes too late for the offeree to either reject the offer or revoke the acceptance.32 However, an acceptance is not effective on dispatch if it is not “made in a manner and by a medium invited”33 by the offer. If the offeree chooses an acceptance not invited by the offer, the mailboxrule does not apply and the acceptance is not effective until receipt. It is important to note that the mailboxrule applies only to acceptances by mail, not revocations. As stated earlier, a revocation is not effective until received by the offeree; hence, a revocation by mail or telegram is not effective until receipt. This means that if an offeror mails an offer and the next day mails a revocation, the offeror may still be bound if the offeree puts an acceptance in the mail after receiving the offer but before receiving the revocation. The mailboxrule binds the offeree as well: once the offeree has mailed an acceptance, it is too late for the offeree to then reject the offer or withdraw the acceptance.
