Created: 2022-08-28 11:26

Court of Appeals California, 1954

129 Cal. App. 2d 179


Plaintiff(s): Lonergan
Defendant(s): Scolnick

### Procedural history:
Trial Court rules in favor of Scolnick (said prompt acceptance was required), Lonergan appeals to Court of Appeals California. 


### Issue:
Did the April 8th letter constitute a contract?

### Facts:
Scolnick owns a 40 acre plot of land. In 1952 placed an ad offering for sale with no price. Lonergan begins to inquire and begins to exchange letters. They discuss land location, minimum price and escrow agent. April 8th 1952 Scolnick tells Longergan to decide fast if interested as he expects to have a buyer by the end of the week. Scolnick sells land to someone else for $2500. Longergan does not receive a letter until April 14th. Longergan replies with an agreement to purchase on April 15th at $2500 and opens escrow account on April 17th. Lonergan sues upon discovering the land has already been sold.

### Rule of law:

### Analysis:

### Holding:
Contracts cannot be formed without mutually agreeable terms. 

### Judgement:

### Rationale:
A promise is not an offer if the recipient knows the promisor did not intend it to be “an expression of his fixed purpose”. Barnard determines there must be a clear offer to make an acceptance. Additional steps must be taken to ensure a “meeting of the minds”.
