## Rule of Law

In contracts in which the performance depends on the continued existence of a given person or thing, a condition is implied that the impossibility of performance arising from the perishing or destruction of the person or thing shall excuse the performance.

## Facts

Caldwell (defendant) owned The Surrey Gardens and Music Hall (hall) and agreed to rent it out to Taylor (plaintiff) for four separate days at a rate of one hundred pounds per day. 

The parties understood that Taylor wished to host a series of concerts at the hall, and their contract included provisions relating to the provision of concert supplies and equipment. 

After the contract was formed, but before the first concert, the hall was destroyed by fire. The destruction was such that Taylor could not host the concerts there as planned. Taylor brought suit against Caldwell to recover damages for the money spent advertising and preparing for the concerts.

## Issue

Whether, when a contract is formed for a specific purpose and unexpected circumstances arising from no fault of the parties make the completion of that purpose impossible, the parties may be excused from performance of the contract.

## Holding and Reasoning (Blackburn, J.)

Yes. The continuing existence of the hall at the time the concerts were to be given is essential to performance of the contract between Taylor and Caldwell, and thus the destruction of the hall excuses performance by both parties. In contracts in which the performance depends on the continued existence of a given person or thing, a condition is implied that the impossibility of performance arising from the perishing or destruction of the person or thing shall excuse the performance. This is analogous to the rule in personal services contracts which states that “where a contract depends upon personal skill, and the act of God renders it impossible, as for instance, in the case of a painter employed to paint a picture who is struck blind, it may be that the performance might be excused.” Thus, if the contract depends on the personal skill of the person and that person is injured or dies, performance of the contract is no longer required. Similarly, in contracts to transport perishable goods, if the goods are destroyed or spoiled in transit through circumstances not arising from the fault of either party, all parties to the contract are excused from performance. In these cases, courts will imply a condition in the contracts that they are to be performed unless unexpected circumstances (death or destruction) make performance impossible. The entirety of the contract between Taylor and Caldwell suggests that it is based upon an implied condition that the hall continues to exist at the time of performance of the contracts. 

Thus, the destruction of the hall through no fault of the parties renders performance of the contract impossible, and excuses performance for both Taylor and Caldwell.
