Created: 2022-08-28 08:01

### Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia 196 VA. 493. ###

Plaintiff(s): W.O. Lucy and J.C. Lucy 
Defendant(s): A.H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer

### Procedural history: 
Lucy brought suit to Circuit Court of Dinwiddie County, ruled in favor of Zehmer- said he was too inebriated to sell. Depositions were taken, decree appealed from was entered. Held that the complainants failed to establish right to specific performance, dismissed the bill, appealed, brought to Supreme Court of Virginia.

### Issue:
is mental assent of both parties required for a contract?

### Facts: 
December 20th 1952 Zehmer and his wife Ida S. Zehmer are enjoying a “couple of drinks” with Lucy. Lucy offers Mr Zehmer $50,000 cash for his farm. Zehmer, believing this to be a joke especially after a few drinks, writes out a memorandum which states “We hereby agree to sell to W.O. Lucy the Ferguson Farm complete for $50,000 title satisfactory to buyer.” He signs and induces his wife to sign as well. Zehmer did not intend to give it to Lucy however Lucy read it, pockets the paper and tries to give Zehmer $5 to seal the bargain. Zehmer refused, said it was a joke and had no intentions on selling. Lucy leaves, insisting he purchased the farm Lucy and his brother JC Lucy sue the Zehmers.

### Rule of law:

### Analysis:

### Holding:
Justice Buchanan ruled with unanimous court to reverse ruling

### Judgement:

### Rationale:
Zehmer was sober enough to decline $5, drove home, “undisclosed intention is immaterial” if words and or actions have but one reasonable meaning to a rational person.
