## Rule of Law

The duty of good faith prevents a party from taking opportunistic advantage of another party in a way that was not resolved explicitly by the parties at the time of drafting and that undermines the parties' cooperative venture.

## Facts

J.C. Penney entered into a sale-leaseback agreement with General Electric Pension Trust (defendant). J.C. Penney was to sell properties to the trust, which the trust leased back to J.C. Penney for 25-year terms. 

- Paragraph 34 of the lease entitled the lessee to request the lessor to finance the costs of construction of improvements to the property, and the lessor agreed to reasonably consider providing the financing and to negotiate in good faith. If negotiations failed, the lease permitted the lessee to repurchase the property. 
- J.C. Penney assigned a lease to Market Street Associates Limited Partnership (Market Street) (plaintiff). Market Street received an inquiry from a drugstore chain that wanted to open a store in the property, provided Market Street could construct the building. 
- Market Street initially sought other financing for the project but was denied because it was only the lessee of the property. Market Street thus tried to buy the property back from the trust. 
- The trust expressed interest in selling the property for $3 million, which Market Street considered too high. Market Street subsequently requested financing from the trust for $2 million. Market Street's financing request did not mention the lease. Market Street sent a second letter to the trust requesting the financing, again without specific reference to paragraph 34. The trust responded that it was only interested in financing loans of over $7 million, and Market Street responded that it would seek financing elsewhere. 

## Procedure 
- When unable to do so, Market Street tried to exercise its option to purchase the property under paragraph 34, but the trust refused to sell. Market Street brought suit to compel specific performance. The district court granted summary judgment to the trust, and Market Street appealed.

## Issue

Does the duty of good faith prevent a party from taking opportunistic advantage of another party in a way that was not resolved explicitly by the parties at the time of drafting and that undermines the parties' cooperative venture?

## Holding and Reasoning (Posner, J.)

Yes. Good faith prevents a party from taking opportunistic advantage of another party in a way that was not resolved explicitly by the parties at the time of drafting and that undermines the parties' cooperative venture. 

- In other words, the concept of good faith ensures that as unforeseen circumstances arise during performance of a contract, the parties behave cooperatively and treat each other how they would have agreed to treat each other if they had foreseen the circumstances when they were negotiating the contract. 

- Here, the key question to determine whether Market Street acted in good faith is whether it tried to trick the trust when it requested financing without referencing paragraph 34. On the trust's motion for summary judgment, the facts must be construed in Market Street's favor. Under that standard, Market Street considered $3 million an excessive price for the property and only sought financing from the pension trust when it discovered that it could not get financing elsewhere. Market Street acted honestly and without any ulterior motive. The fault was the trust's inattention to Market Street’s proposal and financial situation, which ultimately caused Market Street to believe that the trust did not want to finance the improvements regardless of the purchase option. The necessary inquiry into the state of mind of Market Street's representative cannot be made on a motion for summary judgment. 

- Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
