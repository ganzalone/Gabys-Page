## Rule of Law

A merchant buyer does not necessarily act in bad faith when it rejects a nonconforming tender because the market for the resale of the goods has declined.

## Facts

UT Finance Corporation (UTF) (defendant) signed a contract to purchase used airplanes from Austrian Airlines (Austrian) (plaintiff). The sales contract provided that UTF could reject the planes for any nonconformance to delivery conditions in the contract, no matter how minor. This provision was different from the industry custom claimed by Austrian, under which buyers customarily accepted used planes with minor flaws. The planes Austrian tendered had auxiliary center fuel tanks that were unapproved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). UTF rejected the tender due to these nonconformities. Austrian brought suit, alleging that UTF’s rejection was in bad faith. The market for used airplanes had declined since the contract was signed, and Austrian alleged that UTF’s rejection of the tender was due to this market decline as opposed to the fuel tank issues. UTF filed a motion to dismiss.

## Issue

Does a merchant buyer act in bad faith when it rejects a nonconforming tender because the market for the resale of the goods has declined?

## Holding and Reasoning (Kaplan, J.)

No. A merchant buyer does not necessarily act in bad faith when it rejects a nonconforming tender because the market for the resale of the goods has declined. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), merchant buyers have a duty of good faith to perform in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. The UCC seeks to avoid a situation in which a seller is surprised by a buyer’s rejection of a tender. The UCC does permit a seller to cure its nonconforming tender. In this case, Austrian has not demonstrated that UTF rejected the tender in bad faith. Although the market for used airplanes had declined since Austrian and UTF entered into the contract, this does not necessarily mean that UTF breached the duty of good faith by rejecting Austrian’s tender. Furthermore, even assuming Austrian is correct that industry custom is to accept planes with slight flaws, that custom is not relevant to this case, because Austrian contracted away the custom by permitting UTF to reject the tender for any nonconformance, no matter how insignificant. Because Austrian agreed to this in the contract, it could not be surprised when UTF rejected the tender for a nonconformance that customarily would have been accepted. UTF’s rejection of the tender was not in bad faith, but rather was in accordance with the benefit for which it bargained in the contract. UTF’s motion to dismiss is granted.
