##### Parole evidence rule
does not apply to prior & contemporaneous

integration:
1. complete (final statement of all terms, exclusive expression)
2. partial (intended to be final statement of only rules in writing without closing off options]])

if writing omits a consistent ( no contradiction of other terms) then it is still not completely integrated UNLESS it is agreed to for a separate consideration- would this term naturally be omitted from the writing?

additional agreement shown by extrinsic evidence should be taken into consideration

hicks case-

parol evidence rule is only effective on a complete document, a binding agreement

insurance

recitals

218- can you use extrinsic evidence to show that recitals are untrue. 
recitals are not agreements, but statements of facts of which both parties are making by signing the agreement

[[§218. Untrue Recitals; Evidence Of Consideration]]


[[Centronics Corporation v. Genicom Corporation (1989)]]
** in new york, in exercising your right under the contract, certain rights have to be exercised in good faith.
they say breach of contract does not stand as an independent cause of action (ask bc idk if this is right)

if there is an express right under a contract, then a good faith obligation is not implied.

bad faith is when you try to recapture a right that you had given up during negotiations
- court argues that genicom is not trying to recapture a right, rather they already still hold it. 
- burton analysis- if an objective basis exists to infer that the parties never bargained away the right of either of them to condition any distribution on completing the arbitration of any disputes, then genicom can not be guilty of bad faith by so insisting, whatever its subjective motive may be.

- at will employee- employee can be terminated at any time

[[Patterson v. Meyerhofer (1912)]]
meyerhofer prevented patterson from performing, so by preventing patterson from performing he no longer needs to perform. 
*implied obligation to not stop other party from reaping fruits of the contract*


[[Market Street Associates Limited Partnership v. Frey (1991)]]
preventing negotiations from taking place is breaching contract bc a party cannot try to take the advantage 

DUTY OF HONESTY OF GOOD FAITH IS NOT A DUTY OF CANTER


[[Market Street Associates Limited Partnership v. Frey (1991)]]
 sale-leaseback- The primary benefit of a sale-leaseback is **the ability to immediately convert an illiquid asset into liquid capital to meet both short- and long-term needs**, such as paying off debt, purchasing new equipment or investing in growth initiatives.

**need inquiry of state of mind of  market street- inquiry made without referencing pg 34

summary judgement cannot be if there is  question of fact
essential issue of state of mind cannot be determined through summary judgement

*summary judgement- even if "facts" are agreed upon, inferences may be drawn. those would need to be determined by a jury/judge, 
 thus summary judgement not applicable*

[[Omni Group, Inc. v. Seattle-First National Bank (1982)]]
duty of good faith constitutes consideration so it does not make it illusory even if there is a condition precedent regarding satisfaction (as long as that satisfaction is made in good faith)

if a condition is put into a contract for your benefit you can waive it.

if the promise is not a commitment by the buyer, then there is no consideration to support the seller's promise to sell. 
- reasonable effort is an  implied obligation

billman did not make reasonable effort to secure a loan, bound by subject to financing clause

[[Angel v. Murray (1974)]]

James L. Maher (defendant) has operated a refuse-collection service in the City of Newport since 1946 under a series of five-year contracts. 
- Maher originally entered into these contracts with the expectation that refuse-producing dwelling units would steadily increase at a rate of twenty to twenty-five per year. 
- in July 1964, the city experienced a substantial and unanticipated increase of four hundred new dwelling units. In 1967, Maher asked the city council for an additional $10,000 per year to cover the cost of these new units. 
- The city council agreed to pay him $10,000 per year for both 1968 and 1969, for a total of $20,000 beyond the original contract. 
- Alfred L. Angel (plaintiff) brought suit against Maher, the city, and Murray, the Director of Finance on the ground that the payment of $20,000 to Maher was illegal and asking that Maher be ordered to repay that sum to the city. The trial court held the payment illegal and ordered Maher to repay the $20,000. Maher appealed.

The payment of $20,000 to Maher after the unexpected and substantial increase in refuse-producing dwellings is a legal and enforceable modification of Maher’s initial contract with the city. When unexpected or unanticipated difficulties arise during the course of performance of a contract, the parties may modify the initial contract even without additional consideration for the modification as long as the parties voluntarily agree and the promise modifying the initial contract is made before the contract is fully performed on either side, the underlying circumstances prompting the modification are unanticipated by the parties, and the modification is fair and equitable

rule is reflected by Section 89(a) of the American Law Institute’s Restatement, Second, Law of Contracts, and replaces the more traditional preexisting duty rule, providing that an initial contract cannot be modified unless additional consideration is provided beyond the preexisting duties assigned to both parties under the initial contract.

*good faith- observance of standards of fair dealing, facts & honesty
