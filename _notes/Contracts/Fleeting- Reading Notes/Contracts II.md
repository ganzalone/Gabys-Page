##### Parole evidence rule
does not apply to prior & contemporaneous

integration:
1. complete (final statement of all terms, exclusive expression)
2. partial (intended to be final statement of only rules in writing without closing off options]])

if writing omits a consistent ( no contradiction of other terms) then it is still not completely integrated UNLESS it is agreed to for a separate consideration- would this term naturally be omitted from the writing?

additional agreement shown by extrinsic evidence should be taken into consideration

hicks case-

parol evidence rule is only effective on a complete document, a binding agreement

insurance

recitals

218- can you use extrinsic evidence to show that recitals are untrue. 
recitals are not agreements, but statements of facts of which both parties are making by signing the agreement

[[§218. Untrue Recitals; Evidence Of Consideration]]


[[Centronics Corporation v. Genicom Corporation (1989)]]
** in new york, in exercising your right under the contract, certain rights have to be exercised in good faith.
they say breach of contract does not stand as an independent cause of action (ask bc idk if this is right)

if there is an express right under a contract, then a good faith obligation is not implied.

bad faith is when you try to recapture a right that you had given up during negotiations
- court argues that genicom is not trying to recapture a right, rather they already still hold it. 
- burton analysis- if an objective basis exists to infer that the parties never bargained away the right of either of them to condition any distribution on completing the arbitration of any disputes, then genicom can not be guilty of bad faith by so insisting, whatever its subjective motive may be.

- at will employee- employee can be terminated at any time

[[Patterson v. Meyerhofer (1912)]]
meyerhofer prevented patterson from performing, so by preventing patterson from performing he no longer needs to perform. 
*implied obligation to not stop other party from reaping fruits of the contract*


[[Market Street Associates Limited Partnership v. Frey (1991)]]
preventing negotiations from taking place is breaching contract bc a party cannot try to take the advantage 

DUTY OF HONESTY OF GOOD FAITH IS NOT A DUTY OF CANTER


[[Market Street Associates Limited Partnership v. Frey (1991)]]
 sale-leaseback- The primary benefit of a sale-leaseback is **the ability to immediately convert an illiquid asset into liquid capital to meet both short- and long-term needs**, such as paying off debt, purchasing new equipment or investing in growth initiatives.

**need inquiry of state of mind of  market street- inquiry made without referencing pg 34

summary judgement cannot be if there is  question of fact
essential issue of state of mind cannot be determined through summary judgement

*summary judgement- even if "facts" are agreed upon, inferences may be drawn. those would need to be determined by a jury/judge, 
 thus summary judgement not applicable*

[[Omni Group, Inc. v. Seattle-First National Bank (1982)]]
duty of good faith constitutes consideration so it does not make it illusory even if there is a condition precedent regarding satisfaction (as long as that satisfaction is made in good faith)

if a condition is put into a contract for your benefit you can waive it.

if the promise is not a commitment by the buyer, then there is no consideration to support the seller's promise to sell. 
- reasonable effort is an  implied obligation 

[[Billman v. Hensel (1979)]]
billman did not make reasonable effort to secure a loan, bound by subject to financing clause


2-601 buyers rights improper delivery

- good faith a question of fact!

- contract does not specify numbers/quantities (output contract)
- 2-306
- 1-302 (B) 


[[Angel v. Murray (1974)]]

James L. Maher (defendant) has operated a refuse-collection service in the City of Newport since 1946 under a series of five-year contracts. 
- Maher originally entered into these contracts with the expectation that refuse-producing dwelling units would steadily increase at a rate of twenty to twenty-five per year. 
- in July 1964, the city experienced a substantial and unanticipated increase of four hundred new dwelling units. In 1967, Maher asked the city council for an additional $10,000 per year to cover the cost of these new units. 
- The city council agreed to pay him $10,000 per year for both 1968 and 1969, for a total of $20,000 beyond the original contract. 
- Alfred L. Angel (plaintiff) brought suit against Maher, the city, and Murray, the Director of Finance on the ground that the payment of $20,000 to Maher was illegal and asking that Maher be ordered to repay that sum to the city. The trial court held the payment illegal and ordered Maher to repay the $20,000. Maher appealed.

The payment of $20,000 to Maher after the unexpected and substantial increase in refuse-producing dwellings is a legal and enforceable modification of Maher’s initial contract with the city. When unexpected or unanticipated difficulties arise during the course of performance of a contract, the parties may modify the initial contract even without additional consideration for the modification as long as the parties voluntarily agree and the promise modifying the initial contract is made before the contract is fully performed on either side, the underlying circumstances prompting the modification are unanticipated by the parties, and the modification is fair and equitable

rule is reflected by Section 89(a) of the American Law Institute’s Restatement, Second, Law of Contracts, and replaces the more traditional preexisting duty rule, providing that an initial contract cannot be modified unless additional consideration is provided beyond the preexisting duties assigned to both parties under the initial contract.

[[Roth Steel Products v. Sharon Steel Corp. (1983)]]

- p was buying steel from def
- steel prices shot up, p agreed to continue to buy reluctantly because they believed no other reasonable supplier 
- deliveries were late - said there was a shortage
- def was actually saving large quantities of steel to be sold at high prices
- def not acting in good faith 

*good faith- observance of standards of fair dealing, facts & honesty 


[[Beneficial National Bank, U.S.A. v. Payton (2001)]]

payton fills out application for credit card- in the terms and conditions of the cardholder agreement,  a provision that allowed for subsequent changes to be made to the agreement by Beneficial. 
Beneficial subsequently notified its cardholders, including Payton, that it was adding a provision requiring mandatory arbitration in the event of any claim, dispute, or controversy unless Payton rejected the change within 30 days.

WHERE TO REINSTATE THE CONDITION

UCC 222 SUB 4 & 5
205 ill. 9

mutual assent 


parties can make an express condition through agreement
* restatement 226*

palmer v fox
(Palmer) (plaintiff) contracted to sell a lot in one of its subdivisions to Fox (defendant). 

- The contract provided a purchase price of $1,650, of which $247.50 was to be paid when the contract was executed, and the balance was to be paid in monthly installments of $16.50 over the next five years. 
- 
- In exchange for Fox tendering the purchase price, Palmer agreed to provide cement sidewalks on the property and to grade all streets, and either cinderize or gravel the streets. 
- Palmer provided the water mains, lateral sewers, and cement sidewalks, but failed to cinderize or gravel the streets. 
- Fox paid the initial price of $247.50 after the contract was executed, and paid additional monthly installments of $16.50 until February 11, 1931. 
- Fox ceased making additional payments after that time due to Palmer’s failure to cinderize or gravel the streets. 
- 
- On February 7, 1933, Palmer brought suit in Michigan state court against Fox seeking the balance due on the contract plus interest, or $855.91. 
- 
- Fox argued that his promise to pay was dependent on Palmer’s promise to perform improvements, including cinderizing and graveling the streets. 
- Fox argued that Palmer’s breach of this covenant excused his own performance. The trial court awarded damages of $855.91 to Palmer, and Fox appealed.

Yes. The covenants between Palmer and Fox are dependent, and Palmer cannot bring an action for breach against Fox because Palmer failed to perform its own covenant. When the intent of the parties to a contract indicates that covenants are to be performed at the same time, the covenants are dependent and neither party can bring an action for breach against the other unless he has performed his own covenant.

Thus, the promises made by Palmer and Fox were dependent covenants, and Palmer may not bring an action for breach against Fox because Palmer has failed to fulfill its own covenant. The decision of the trial court is reversed.

-they are performed simultaneously -- unless contractual language shows otherwise we presume its due simultaneously 

was there a material failure of performance?
what is the condition precedent to perform? 

comment c to 225 
effect of excuse

240- divisibility

jacob n youngs 

condition of presumable intention are to tell us if a condition shoudl be depentdent or independent

if there is not an EXPRESS condition, substantial performance suffices and the plaintiff cannot sue for so much 

breach- is there a MATERIAL failure of performance by the contractor?

once court decides there should be no uncured material performance, court now has to determine how much damages are to be received if the duty isnt 100%

willfull transgression must accept the penalty of th transgression- some look at it just as an item to take into consideration, if ur willfull to commit the transfression no mercy for u 

241- determining whether a failure is material 
227- standards of preference w regard to conditions

read the oppenheimer case

245, 246.\, 247






227-
nonuccerence of obligors duty may cause obligee to lose the right they have under the contract to receive payment/ wha they are due

condition does not HAVE to occur, but a timespan is placed in when it ordinarily occurs- the event is placed not to create a condition but measure a passage of time

unless the event is within the obligee's control-- he hcould have the event occur within the time period, or if circumstances prove the obligee assumed the risk of forfeiture.

(2)  Unless the contract is of a type under which only one party generally undertakes duties, when it is doubtful whether

(a)  a duty is imposed on an obligee that an event occur, or

(b)  the event is made a condition of the obligor's duty, or

(c)  the event is made a condition of the obligor's duty and a duty is imposed on the obligee that the event occur,  
the first interpretation is preferred if the event is within the obligee's control.

 event- is it a promise (imposing a duty in the case the event occurs?) or is the event made a condition of the obligors duty 

it is preferable to construe an event as a promise over a condition

if b does not use reasonable effort,

conditions

H.B. Taylor v Johnston
- based upon the conduct, the trial court determined that the conduct amounted to a repudiation 
- r2 250

conditions that may happen in the future- nonoccurrence can be excused unless otherwise

the excuse of express condition -229
- not material is ok
- 245

- excuses of conditions
- Repudiation
- Impracticability
- Frustration

repudiation-
-has to be voluntary & affirmative 

anticipatory repudiation- 
consequences of repudiation

250- language that cumulates to intention to not perform must be conspicuous 
mere doubt does not lead to repudiation

gravity breach- threatened breach must be of strong enough gravity to give oglibee enough for a total breach- its gotta be MATERIAL

wrongful statement of repudiation (threaten) BC IT DURESS DESTROYS MANIFESTATION OF ASSENT- unless he accepts modification the statement is repudiation 

failure of assurance of repudiation 
in cases of anticipation, must find assurance

scope 253-

estoppel, an obligor must perform if (1) the obligor promised to perform despite the nonoccurrence; (2) the obligee changed his position in reasonable, foreseeable, and detrimental reliance on that promise; and (3) enforcing the condition would unfairly harm the obligee.

waiver- excuse nonperformance of condition
An obligor may also waive a condition by (1) expressly communicating intent to waive the condition or (2) accepting the obligee’s performance despite knowing of the nonoccurrence of the condition. However, a waiver is not binding on the obligor if (1) the occurrence of the condition is a material part of the consideration for which the obligor bargained for (_i.e._, if nonoccurrence would deprive the obligor of the substantial benefit of the bargain), or (2) the obligor assumed the risk that the condition would not occur.

Express warranties may be created by statements made by the seller about the product, by a description of the product, or by a sample or floor model, which warrants that the goods will conform to the sample or model. _See_ U.C.C. § 2-313 (2002).

damages- read sullivan case
damages 
section 344 - judicial remedies under the rules
3 interests being protected-

346 of restatement- 

usually cannot get punitive damages unless receiving compensatory damages
(in contracts u almost never get punitive damages)

347- measure of damages in general 


344- remedies

349- measuring reliance interest
 
371- HOW TO MEASURE RESTITUTION

parties need to make reasonable efforts to avoid the consequences of the breach
-if they take steps to prevent further loss due to breach, they must take those steps - doctrine of mitigation/avoidable consequences

352- hydroform case

note 2 - pg 988 in textbook

pg 1021- note 5

if its a losing contract- you may seek restitution as a measure to recover as an alternative
-if amount of loss is equal to amt of reliance you get nothing

the plaintiff failed to prove they were entitled to restitution

### Severable Contract

Also called a divisible contract, an agreement that includes multiple promises subject to separate performance and enforcement.

The rule with divisible contracts is that **a party that performs one or more parts of the contract is entitled to collect the contract price for those parts even if he breaches other parts of the contract**.

was there a material failure of performance?- if there was they cannot collect
lowy v united pacific insurance (1064)

material failure of performance includes when there is no breach, you can be excused from performance due to impossibility/impracticability so its not a breach, but its still a material failure

RESTATEMENT 374!!!!!

rare to get ED or punitive damages in a contract case.

A - B IN CONTRACT
B DOES NOT WANT TO PERFORM
WHAT IS THE CONDITION PRECEDENT TO B'S DUTY TO PERFORM?
- section 237 "it is a condition of each parties remaining duties"- it is a condition where a contract holds an exchnage of promises 
- section 235- when performance under a conttact is due (when performance has occured) and it does not occur it is a breach

section 225- effects on non occurrence of a condition


11/22/22

## damages continued

limitation to damages- mitigation, forseeability, reasonable certainty 

just because you are harmed you wont necessarily receive recovery 

kaplan case

court says no independent thought because the jury found for the defendants
difficulty is determining if pain & suffering are actual contractual damages in the context of the contract.

causation & entitlement to specific types of damages

money damages = to loss of bargain (makes recoverer whole)
but what if $ damages isnt enough?
specific preformance!

360- adequacy of damages
