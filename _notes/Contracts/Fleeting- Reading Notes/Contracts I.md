# Contracts I
Created: 2022-08-28 07:59

Issue is the REASONS there was or was not a contract

Contracts are consensual, voluntary based on terms and conditions agreed upon

We hold freedom from a contract (no force)

Contract law lives in the records of judicial decisions*

Restatements are not necessarily law, but precedents

However, when articles of the UCC are adopted by states (ex articles 1 & 2) they become law

Contract requires:
1. bargain
2. manifestation of mutual assent

Source of contract law- precedents set in English common law. Goods law is set in the UCC. 

Manifestation is subjective vs. objective*- did both parties manifest to the same terms.


What is a contract? Legal obligation that results from an agreement


Offer- a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain that allows manifestation of assent and mutual terms.

“Meeting of the minds”

can only be accepted by signature of the trust- specified mode of acceptance


^interpreted to be a PRESCRIBED method

Document was not executed by trust, thus no mutual assent, thus there was no contract
  

Is signature REQUIRED or one type of method to do so?

To state that upon execution the contract would be in full force, then it is required.

When an offer is made, the offeree is given the power to accept

Acceptance of the offer is what creates a contract- section 5 of restatement

  

However, section 17 states

Formation must require manifestation of mutual assent to the exchange and consideration

  

Ad typically not considered an offer as it is to the general public

Not ordinarily intended or understood to be offers, must be some action to make commitment without further consideration , invitation to performance

  

*”first come first serve”- specifies the offer to a limited amount of people, now not simply the general public 


Offeror can revoke offer at any time


HOW WAS ACCEPTANCE INVITED?- UPON PERFORMANCE OR WRITTEN ACCEPTANCE

Manifest intention towards a particular individual

Offeror is master, only bount by manifested assent

Power of acceptance may be narrowly limited

However, creating an appearance of assent may bind him


IF:

Only mode of acceptance is performance:

It is an options contact. Offeree not bound to complete performance as no promise was made
  

IF:

Invites EITHER acceptance by promise or performance;

It is a bilateral contract. To begin is to accept by performance. Acceptance operates as a promise to render complete performance. 

  

How to terminate power of acceptance:

-rejection or counter offer by offeree

-lapse of time

-revocation by offeror

-death by incapacity of offeror or offeree

-non-occurence of any condition of acceptance under terms of offer


Beneficial National Bank v Payton

Credit card notification suit, individual had opportunity to reject but did not (silence as acceptance)


Dickinson v. Dodds


Revocation can be implied by conduct

  
  

Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Westwise Investment Corp.

  

Option contract has consideration

Meaning requirements for formation of a contract

  

GENERALLY- mirror image acceptance- must accept offer as given 

Irrevocable option contract offeror must keep open for specified amount of time

If an offer is “guaranteed” or “firm” it is irrevocable for max of 3 months unless renewed

  

Offeree not obligated to perform once partial performance has begun (?)

 
  

Offeror takes definite action

Offerees power of acceptance  is terminated

Consistent w intent to enter contract

  

Revocation of a general offer ex in a newspaper revocation must be terminate offer by equal or better means

Termination by lapse of time

Termination at time specified in offer or at end of a reasonable amount of time

  
For options contract- 

  

Most offers ARE revocable

Even if contract is explicitly expressed

Revocation has to be communicated & received


  

Acceptance & proposal

If both parties are consumers

IF both parties are merchants - if proposal is a material form it wont become part of contract unless accepted

CONSIDERATION

  
PERSON MAKES PROMISE- UNENFORACABLE WITHOUT MUTUAL ASCENT AND CONSIDERATION 

TO CONSTITUTE CONSIDERATION: PROMISE OR PERFORMANCE BUT HAS TO BE BARGAINED FOR

TTO BARGAIN FOR- PROMISE OR PERFORMANCE, IN RETURN THERE MUST BE A PROMISE OR A PERFORMANCE MADE 

PROMISSOR SEEKS PROMISE/PERFORMANCE, MUST GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR PROMISOR’S PROMISE 

  

PERFORMANCE OR RETURN PROMISE (WHAT IS BEING SOUGHT) MAY BE GIVEN TO PROMISOR OR A THIRD PARTY

RETURN PROMISE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE GIVEN TO PROMISOR (STILL CONSIDERATION)

  

EX

PROMISEE WANTS TO ENFORCE A PROMISE- CAN GIVE PROMISE OR ENFORCE THROUGH A THIRD PARTY

  
  
  
 
IF THERE IS A BARGAIN FOR PUTTING A LIMITATION ON FREEDOM 



IN re Farnham Greene

Is the dollar consideration

§79 comment D

March 9 2022


“The relative values of a promise and the consideration for it, do not affect the sufficiency of consideration” § 81

  

Doctrine of Unconscionability: is concerned with process where there is no fraud, duress or mistake

  

Preexisting Duty Rule

This rule provides that the performance or promise to perform a preexisting legal duty does not constitute consideration

  

Whether or not duty has to be owed to the party that makes the promise

  

A  and B have contract

B is gonna do it for 50$ is gonna perform

B tells A only if i get $65

A says hell nah

C, who has an interest in the performance of this service, tells B i’ll pay if u do it

B is under duty

C can claim that B is under duty to perform to A not C, so C can be like hell nah i aint payin fr

  

If promise being made by C to B and B is promising to act on what he is obligated to A to do (not obligated to C though) restatements do be sayin that it is in fact consideration


Mutuality of Obligation

  

Rehm-Zeiher v. F.G. Walker Co. 

Court of Appeals of Kentucky, 1913

  

McMichael v. Price 

Supreme Court of Oklahoma, 1936

  

Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon 

Court of Appeals of New York, 1917 

Lack of consideration

Does a contract fail for lack of consideration

  

No. Consideration exists if contexts implied promise to make reasonable efforts
