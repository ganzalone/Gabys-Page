## Rule of Law

Assault requires that a person acts while intending a harmful or offensive contact with another or acts while intending to produce a reasonable apprehension of an imminent battery, causing mental or emotional damages.

## Facts

Cullison (plaintiff) met Sandy Medley, a teenager, in a grocery store parking lot and invited her over to his home. Later that day, Sandy and the rest of the Medley family (defendants) came to Cullison’s mobile home and confronted Cullison about his meeting with Sandy. Sandy’s father, Ernest, had a revolver strapped to his leg, and repeatedly reached for it and shook the gun at Cullison throughout the encounter. Ernest threatened to jump on Cullison, while Sandy’s mother, Doris, kept her hand in her pocket, convincing Cullison that Doris also had a weapon. Cullison feared that one of the Medleys was about to shoot him and felt intimidated by the five people inside his trailer. After the confrontation, Cullison learned that Ernest had previously shot someone. Cullison then felt great apprehension when Ernest, armed with a pistol, glared menacingly at him in a restaurant. Due to the encounters with the Medleys, Cullison experienced severe emotional and psychological harm. Cullison brought a claim of assault against the Medleys, and the trial court granted the Medleys’ motion for summary judgment. The court of appeals affirmed, reasoning that the Medleys did not indicate any present intent to hurt Cullison, and even if an assault occurred, Cullison could not recover because he only alleged emotional harm.

## Issue

May a person be liable for assault when the plaintiff only alleges emotional harm?

## Holding and Reasoning (Krahulik, J.)

Yes. Assault only requires mental or emotional damages, caused when a person acts while intending a harmful or offensive contact or acts while intending to produce a reasonable apprehension of an imminent battery. This apprehension must be one usually produced in a reasonable person’s mind. The tort of assault aims to protect a person’s right to be free from apprehension of a battery. Historically, assaults are deemed to be a “touching of the mind,” instead of the body, and therefore only mental and emotional damages are recoverable. Various actions may constitute assault, such as a threatening gesture, aiming a weapon, or forcefully surrounding a person. If true, Cullison’s allegations describe an assault by the Medleys. A jury could reasonably find that the Medleys intended to produce apprehension of an imminent battery in Cullison by their actions. Additionally, a jury could conclude that Cullison’s apprehension was reasonable. Cullison’s failure to allege physical harm is immaterial, and Cullison may recover for his mental and emotional harm. The decision of the court of appeals is reversed.
