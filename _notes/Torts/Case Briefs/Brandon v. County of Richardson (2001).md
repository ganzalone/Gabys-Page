## Rule of Law

Extreme and outrageous conduct from a person in a position of power can give rise to an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

## Facts

JoAnn Brandon (plaintiff) filed suit against the County of Richardson (defendant) and Sheriff Charles Laux (defendant) for negligence, wrongful death, and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of events leading up to, and including, the murder of her daughter, Teena. Teena identified as a male and began dating a woman in a nearby town. Subsequently, John Lotter and Thomas Nissen violently beat and raped Teena. Teena reported the sexual assault to Sheriff Laux and was questioned about the incident in a confrontational and extremely graphic manner by Laux. The questioning was captured on a tape recording. At the time Teena reported the rape, Laux was aware that Lotter and Nissen had criminal pasts and had made specific threats on Teena's life following the rape. Subsequently, Teena and two others were found murdered in Richardson County, and Lotter and Nissen were tried for the murders. During the trial, several law-enforcement officers testified that Laux's conduct during the interview was inappropriate, and one officer called Laux's conduct "very unprofessional" and "outrageous." Lotter and Nissen were convicted of the murders. The trial court, sitting without a jury, found the County negligent and awarded economic damages in the amount of $6,223.20 and non-economic damages of $80,000. However, the trial court reduced the award on the negligence claim by 85 percent for the intentional torts of Lotter and Nissen and by 1 percent for Teena's own negligence and denied recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress. JoAnn Brandon appealed, and the County cross-appealed. On appeal, JoAnn Brandon claimed, among other things, that the trial court erred in denying recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

## Issue

Can extreme and outrageous conduct from a person in a position of power give rise to an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress?

## Holding and ReasoningÂ (Hendry, C.J.)

Yes. Extreme and outrageous conduct from a person in a position of power can give rise to an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Determining whether conduct is extreme and outrageous is judged using an objective standard. The relationship between the parties and the susceptibility of the plaintiff are important factors to consider. Mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities that result from living in society do not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct. However, conduct which might otherwise be considered merely rude or abusive may be deemed outrageous if the defendant knows that the plaintiff is particularly susceptible to emotional distress. In this case, it is unquestionable that Laux was in a position of authority relative to Teena. Laux knew that Teena had just been beaten and raped and was in a vulnerable state at the time Laux conducted the extremely graphic and confrontational interview. Laux's conduct during the interview is undisputed, as it was captured by the tape recording. There is no justification for Laux's conduct, and indeed, the law-enforcement officers who testified at trial characterized Laux's conduct as unprofessional, inappropriate, and outrageous. Because Laux's conduct during the interview was extreme and outrageous, the trial court erred in holding that it was not. Accordingly, the case is remanded for consideration of whether Teena suffered severe emotional distress as a result of Laux's conduct. If the court finds that Teena did not suffer severe emotional distress or that Laux's conduct was not a proximate cause of the distress, then JoAnn Brandon may not recover on this claim. However, if the court finds that Teena suffered severe emotional distress that was proximately caused by Laux's conduct, the court is directed to award damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
