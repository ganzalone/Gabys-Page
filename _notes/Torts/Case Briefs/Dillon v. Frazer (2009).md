# Dillon v. Frazer

South Carolina Supreme Court

678 S.E.2d 251 (2009)


## Rule of Law

A plaintiff can recover compensatory damages in a tort action for medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, and any special damages sustained as a result of the defendant’s tortious conduct.

## Facts

Noel Dillon (plaintiff) was injured in a car accident caused by Neil Frazer (defendant). Dillon suffered ten broken ribs, a broken sternum, a broken clavicle, a broken thumb, and a punctured lung. As a result of the injuries, Dillon could not return to work for approximately ten weeks, and upon his return he could not work as many hours as he did prior to the accident. Dillon brought suit against Frazer. Frazer admitted fault for the accident. Dillon sought over $500,000 in damages, of which approximately $30,000 were not disputed, including medical bills, physical therapy bills, and lost wages. The jury awarded Dillon $6,000. Dillon filed a motion for a new trial _nisi additur_, or in the alternative, a new trial on damages. The trial court increased the damages award to $21,000. Dillon appealed.

## Issue

Can a plaintiff recover compensatory damages in a tort action for medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, and any special damages sustained as a result of the defendant’s tortious conduct?

## Holding and Reasoning (Pleicones, J.)

Yes. A plaintiff can recover compensatory damages in a tort action for medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, and any special damages sustained as a result of the defendant’s tortious conduct. The trial court has discretion with respect to awards of damages, including jury verdicts. The trial court must grant a new trial if the verdict is so grossly inadequate or excessive that it shocks the conscience. The court should not grant a new trial for an award that is merely conservative or liberal, but only for an award that is so inadequate or excessive that it must be based on passion, prejudice, or some other subjective basis. In this case, the trial court abused its discretion in not granting Dillon a new trial on damages. The undisputed evidence at trial demonstrated that Dillon incurred over $30,000 in medical costs and lost wages. An award of $6,000 is grossly inadequate in light of these undisputed damages. This disparity is so large that the jury’s award is not merely conservative but is indicative of some improper motive. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial on damages.
