## Rule of Law

An offensive touching can occur if a tortfeasor has knowledge of a person’s unusual susceptibility and the tortfeasor then violates that susceptibility, even if a reasonable person would not be offended by the touching.

## Facts

Cohen (plaintiff) was admitted to a hospital to give birth. After a doctor informed Cohen that she would need a cesarean section, Cohen told the doctor that her religious beliefs prevented a male from seeing her naked. In turn, the doctor informed Smith (defendant), a male nurse, of Cohen’s beliefs. During Cohen’s surgery, Smith viewed and touched Cohen’s unclothed body. Cohen brought a battery claim against Smith, and the trial court dismissed the complaint.

## Issue

Is an offensive touching committed if a tortfeasor touches a person in a way not offensive to a reasonable person, but after the person has informed the tortfeasor of an unusual susceptibility to the touching?

## Holding and Reasoning (Chapman, J.)

Yes. An offensive touching occurs if the tortfeasor knew of a person’s susceptibility to the touching, even if the touching would not be offensive to a person of ordinary sensibilities. A main rationale for the tort of battery is to protect personal integrity, which explains why battery encompasses offensive touching in addition to harmful touching. In some cases, the insult caused by a battery can inflict greater harm than the physical damage. A patient has every right to determine the extent of his or her own medical treatment, and an action by a doctor without the patient’s consent may result in liability. Similar to the case at hand is a series of cases involving Jehovah’s Witnesses, who refused blood transfusions because of their religious beliefs. Even though most individuals would accept a life-saving blood transfusion, courts have held that a doctor who knows about and violates this religious conviction could be liable for battery. Most people would accept being naked and touched by the opposite sex while undergoing surgery. However, Smith knew about Cohen’s religious beliefs and touched her while she was unclothed. Therefore, Smith may be liable for battery. The decision of the trial court is reversed.
