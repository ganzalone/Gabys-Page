# Snyder v. Turk (1993)

*627 N.E.2d 1053 (1993)*

## Rule of Law

To be liable for battery, a person must both intend to cause and actually cause a harmful or offensive contact, defined as contact offending a reasonable sense of personal dignity.

## Facts

Turk (defendant) was a doctor performing an operation assisted by Snyder (plaintiff), a nurse. Turk believed that Snyder was making mistakes during the operation, which was not going well. Upset with Snyder for handing him an instrument that was too short, Turk pulled Snyder’s face toward the surgical site to show Snyder why Turk needed long instruments. Snyder then brought a battery claim against Turk. Turk asserted that he did not intend to cause Snyder personal injury, and the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of Turk.

## Issue

May a person be liable for battery absent intent to cause personal injury?

## Holding and Reasoning (Wilson, J.)

Yes. A person may be liable for battery when only intending to cause an offensive contact. The tort of battery requires that a person intend to cause and actually cause a harmful or offensive contact. An offensive contact is any contact offending a reasonable sense of personal dignity. The evidence suggests that Turk could have intended to cause an offensive contact by forcing Snyder’s face toward the surgical site. Therefore, the trial court should have submitted the question to the jury. The decision to grant a directed verdict in favor of Turk is reversed.
