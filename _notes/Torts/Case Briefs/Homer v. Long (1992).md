## Rule of Law

When a defendant’s extreme and outrageous conduct is directed at person other than the plaintiff, the defendant is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress if he or she intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to a member of the plaintiff’s immediate family in the presence of the plaintiff, or to any person in the presence of the plaintiff if such distress causes the plaintiff bodily harm.

## Facts

Mr. Homer (plaintiff) and Ms. Homer were married when Ms. Homer began to suffer from depression. While Ms. Homer was hospitalized, Dr. Long (defendant) took advantage of her condition and seduced her. Eventually, Ms. Homer and Mr. Homer divorced. Mr. Homer brought a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress against Dr. Long.

## Issue

May a defendant be liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress when his or her extreme and outrageous conduct is not directed at the plaintiff?

## Holding and Reasoning (Wilner, C.J.)

Yes. When a defendant’s extreme and outrageous conduct is directed at a person other than the plaintiff, the defendant is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress if he or she intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to a member of the plaintiff’s immediate family in the presence of the plaintiff, or to any person in the presence of the plaintiff if such distress causes the plaintiff bodily harm. A defendant is usually only liable if the conduct is extreme and outrageous as to the plaintiff, not just to another person or society at large. When the plaintiff is present, however, courts have found that a defendant may know that his or her conduct will very likely cause severe emotional distress to the plaintiff. For a court to apply the “presence” rule, the defendant must know that the plaintiff is present at the scene, so that the defendant can anticipate the likely effect of the conduct on the plaintiff. For example, a defendant who kills a man in the presence of his wife is highly likely to anticipate causing the wife severe emotional distress. Here, Ms. Homer likely viewed Dr. Long’s conduct as extreme and outrageous, however, Ms. Homer is not the plaintiff in this case. Because Mr. Homer was not present at the scene, Dr. Long cannot be liable for his severe emotional distress. Accordingly, Mr. Homer’s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress against Dr. Long must fail.
