## Rule of Law

A party is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress only if the party’s conduct is so outrageous and extreme that it goes beyond all possible bounds of decency and is regarded as utterly intolerable in civilized society.

## Facts

Mark Chanko was struck by a vehicle. He was taken to the emergency room of The New York and Presbyterian Hospital (defendant). At the time, ABC News (defendant) was in the hospital filming a documentary. The ABC News crew members did not inform Mark’s wife, Anita Chanko (plaintiff), of the filming of the documentary and did not receive Mark or Anita’s consent to be included in the film. Nevertheless, ABC News filmed the doctor pronouncing Mark dead and the doctor informing Anita of his death. Anita was not aware of the filming until the documentary was aired and she recognized the scenes on television. ABC News edited the scenes to omit Mark’s name and blurred the image of Mark in his hospital bed. Chanko sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The appellate court affirmed. Anita appealed.

## Issue

Is a party liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress if the party’s conduct is not so outrageous and extreme that it goes beyond all possible bounds of decency?

## Holding and Reasoning (Stein, J.)

No. A party is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress only if the conduct is so outrageous and extreme that it goes beyond all possible bounds of decency and is regarded as utterly intolerable in civilized society. This is a high bar for a plaintiff to meet. The elements needed to establish a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress are (1) extreme and outrageous conduct, (2) intent to cause emotional distress with such conduct, (3) causal connection, and (4) severe emotional distress. In this case, the lower courts did not err in holding that Anita has not met the high bar of establishing a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. While Anita’s complaint purports to plead each of the elements of the claim, the alleged conduct by ABC News does not reach the required level of outrageousness. Many would consider ABC News’s conduct inappropriate or disgraceful. But the conduct is not so outrageous and extreme that it goes beyond all possible bounds of decency. The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.
