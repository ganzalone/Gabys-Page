## Rule of Law

In a dual intent jurisdiction, a tortfeasor must both intentionally contact another person and intend that the contact be harmful or offensive to be liable for battery.

## Facts

White (defendant) moved her elderly grandmother, Everly, into a nursing home. While at the home, Everly showed signs of dementia, becoming easily agitated and acting aggressive. Muniz (plaintiff) was changing Everly’s diaper with little cooperation from Everly, when Everly struck Muniz. Muniz then brought a battery claim against Everly and White. The trial judge instructed the jury to find Everly liable for battery only if she intended to strike Muniz and intended that her conduct be offensive. The jury then found that Everly and White were not liable for battery. The court of appeals reversed, however, finding that the trial court erred in its jury instruction.

## Issue

To be liable for battery, must a person intend that contact with another cause a harmful or offensive result?

## Holding and Reasoning (Kourlis, J.)

Yes. A dual intent jurisdiction requires that a tortfeasor both intend to cause the contact and intend for the contact to be harmful or offensive. Some jurisdictions use a single intent approach for battery, requiring that the tortfeasor only intend to cause the contact with another person. Under the single intent approach, a person need only willingly touch another and cause a harmful or offensive result to be liable for battery. Whether the actor intended for any harm or offense to occur would be irrelevant. However, in a dual intent jurisdiction like Colorado, an actor must intend for harm or offense to occur. It may be difficult for a jury to establish the mental state of a potential tortfeasor with certainty, but the fact finder may use circumstantial evidence to determine the actor’s probable intentions. In the case at hand, the jury had to evaluate whether Everly understood the offensiveness of her actions by considering her mental capabilities and any other relevant personal characteristics. The jury presumably considered these factors in finding that Everly lacked the necessary intent for battery. Because the trial court’s instructions correctly directed the jury to evaluate Everly’s mental state, the decision of the court of appeals is reversed.
