## Rule of Law

A person is justified in using physical force against another person to defend herself or a third party from what she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by the other.

## Facts

Sarah Grimes (plaintiff) got into an altercation with Kristen Saban (defendant) in Saban’s apartment. The altercation became physical, resulting in Grimes suffering injuries. Grimes brought suit against Saban for assault and battery. Saban claimed self-defense, testifying that she was in her bedroom with the door locked when Grimes escalated the altercation by banging on the door and yelling. Saban claimed that when she opened her door, Grimes got within inches of Saban’s face and continued yelling. Saban testified that she then pushed Grimes because she reasonably believed that Grimes would imminently use physical force against her. Grimes testified that when Saban opened the bedroom door, Grimes initially backed away from the door before Saban pushed her. The trial court granted Saban’s motion for summary judgment. Grimes appealed.

## Issue

Is a person justified in using physical force against another person to defend herself or a third party from what she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by the other?

## Holding and Reasoning (Bryan, J.)

Yes. A person is justified in using physical force against another person to defend herself or a third party from what she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by the other. The person is justified in using only the amount of force she reasonably believes is necessary to defend herself or the third party. In this case, the trial court erred in granting Saban summary judgment. A genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Saban reasonably believed that Grimes would imminently use physical force against her when Saban first pushed Grimes. On a motion for summary judgment, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. When viewed in this light, Grimes’s testimony that she initially backed away from Saban raises a factual dispute bearing on the reasonableness of Saban’s belief that Grimes was imminently going to use physical force against her. Disposition of Grimes’s claim is thus not appropriate on summary judgment. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the case is remanded.
