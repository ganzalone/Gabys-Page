# Van Camp v. McAfoos

Iowa Supreme Court

156 N.W.2d 878 (Iowa 1968)

## Rule of Law

A plaintiff must allege fault to successfully plead a cause of action in tort, by alleging either intentional or negligent wrongful conduct by the defendant.

## Facts

McAfoos (defendant), a three-year-old child, was riding a tricycle on a sidewalk and collided with Van Camp (plaintiff) without warning. Van Camp suffered injuries to her leg and brought a tort claim against McAfoos. The trial court sustained McAfoos’s motion to dismiss, stating that Van Camp failed to allege fault on the part of McAfoos. Van Camp appealed the decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.

## Issue

To survive a motion to dismiss a tort claim, must a plaintiff allege fault by the defendant?

## Holding and Reasoning (Becker, J.)

Yes. A plaintiff must allege either intentional or negligent wrongful conduct by the defendant to plead a prima facie case in tort. Case law demonstrates that young children may be liable in tort, but all such cases require some element of fault. Invasion of Van Camp’s person alone does not show fault by McAfoos. Furthermore, Van Camp did not specifically plead any intentional or negligent wrongful conduct, and fault by McAfoos cannot be inferred from the facts at hand. Van Camp did not allege any wrongful conduct and therefore failed to make out a prima facie case. 

## Judgement:
Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.
