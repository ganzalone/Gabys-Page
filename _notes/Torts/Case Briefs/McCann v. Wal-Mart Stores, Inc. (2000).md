## Rule of Law

False imprisonment occurs when a tortfeasor, using any means of duress, intentionally confines a victim in a boundary fixed by the tortfeasor, and the victim is either aware of or harmed by the confinement.

## Facts

Debra McCann (plaintiff) and her two sons were shopping at a Wal-Mart (defendant) store. After the McCanns paid at the register, two Wal-Mart employees blocked them from leaving the store. The employees asserted that McCann’s sons had previously been caught stealing and were not allowed in the store. However, the employees were mistaken and were confusing the McCanns with another family. The Wal-Mart employees escorted the McCanns to an area near the exit, and one employee left, claiming to be calling the police. McCann offered to show her identification, but the remaining employee refused to look at it. When one of McCann’s sons asked to go the bathroom, the employee told the boy that he could not leave. After an hour, the Wal-Mart employees realized their mistake and let the McCanns leave the store. McCann brought a claim of false imprisonment against Wal-Mart, and the jury ruled in favor of McCann.

## Issue

Does false imprisonment require “actual, physical restraint”?

## Holding and Reasoning (Boudin, J.)

No. Confinement may be accomplished by any means of duress, such as a physical barrier, physical force, a threat of physical force, or a false claim of legal power to confine. While the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has not completely defined the tort, common law false imprisonment occurs when a tortfeasor, using any means of duress, intentionally confines a victim in a boundary fixed by the tortfeasor, and the victim is either aware of or harmed by the confinement. Wal-Mart points to the case of _Knowlton v. Ross_, 114 Maine 18 (1915), claiming that _Knowlton_ states that false imprisonment requires “actual, physical restraint.” This phrase is taken out of context, however, and merely reinforces the requirement that the plaintiff be actually confined, and unable to leave the area of confinement. The Restatement and the common law agree that confinement can be satisfied by a mere claim of legal power to confine or an implicit threat of physical force. In the case at hand, Wal-Mart employees escorted the McCanns to an isolated area, threatened to call the police, made the McCanns wait for the police to arrive, and told Jonathan McCann that he could not go to the bathroom. Reasonable people in this situation might believe that they would be physically restrained if they attempted to leave, or that the Wal-Mart employees were claiming legal power to confine them. Because false imprisonment does not require “actual, physical restraint,” the jury verdict is affirmed.
