## Rule of Law

The intent required for a showing of battery does not require a desire on the part of the defendant to harm someone.

## Facts

Jane Doe (plaintiff) engaged in consensual, unprotected sexual intercourse with Earvin Johnson (defendant). Johnson had the HIV virus at the time and transmitted the virus to Doe through the sexual contact. Doe brought suit against Johnson for battery. Johnson filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that he did not intend to transmit the disease to Doe and thus cannot be liable for battery.

## Issue

Does the intent required for a showing of battery require a desire on the part of the defendant to harm someone?

## Holding and Reasoning (Enslen, J.)

No. The intent required for a showing of battery does not require a desire on the part of the defendant to harm someone. Battery is the intentional harmful or offensive touching of another without consent. The required intent is an intent to make physical contact; an intent, or lack of intent, to harm is irrelevant. In this case, Johnson’s claimed lack of intent to harm Doe is irrelevant to whether Doe has stated a claim on which relief can be granted. Johnson argued that because Doe did not claim that Johnson intended to harm her, she did not state a valid battery claim. Johnson’s argument is incorrect. The intent requirement for battery involves the intent to make physical contact, not the intent to do harm. Doe claimed that Johnson intended to have sexual contact with her. This is sufficient to meet the intent requirement at this state of the proceeding. Johnson’s motion to dismiss is denied.
