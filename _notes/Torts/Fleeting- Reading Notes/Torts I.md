2# Torts I
Created: 2022-08-28 21:21

torts- wrongs recognized by law as grounds for a lawsuit

defendant at fault because he intends harm or acts unreasonable to risk harm

element- all must be proven
a requirement must be proven to support cause of action or affirmative defense

cause of action- claim against a person who committed the tort (specific wrong) if proven, gives P right to remedy

tort liability:
1. intentional torts
2. negligence
3. strict liability

sources of tort law:
1. statutes
2. common law

goals of system:
1. detterence
2. compensate victims

prima facie case-specific elements  plaintiff proves to support a cause of action
affirmative defense-releases D from liability despite P proving prima facie case

restatements are an attempt to SUMMARIZE the common law- does not reflect current state of the law

reasonability is an OBJECtiVE test for judge/jury to execute

rationale for strict liabiity?
- encourage greater investment in safety. reasonable care isnt enough
- consumers do not have time nor expertise to evaluate products correctly
- proof problems- negligence difficult to prove, strict liability allows consumer better chance of recovery
- cost spreading- defects are bound to happen, companies can build payouts into their budget

damages- medical bills, lost wages, pain & suffering

showing INTENT
1. wanted to cause harm
2. substantial certainty harm will come
3. transfer of intent

intent
- known danger causes to be only a foreseeable risk which a reasonable person would avoid & becomes in the mind of the actor a substantial certainty

intent is a SUBJECTIVE standard

vs 

negligence
- conduct creates an unreasonable risk of harm

reasonability is an OBJECTIVE standard

transfer of intent
- tort to tort
- victim to victim

##### intentional torts
what does intent mean?

intentional torts
- battery
- assault
- false imprisonment
- intention infliction of emotional distress
- trespass to land
- trespass to chattels
- conversion

affirmative defenses
- consent
- self defense & defense of others
- private necessity
- public necessity

intent generally means an intent to cause some consequence

- an act is "intentional" if the actor
	1. WANTED to cause the consequence OR
	2. KNEW the consequence was substantially certain to result OR
	3. TRANSFERRED intent applies

battery- to make prima facie case, the plaintiff must show that defendant intentionally caused a harmful or offensive contact with the person of plaintiff
-protects personal dignity & body
- intent
	- to satisfy the intent for battery, p must show that D wanted, knew, or transferred intent to cause harm 
- harmful or offensive contact
	- a contact is harmful is
	- a contact is offensive if
- with plaintiff's person


a matter of perspective
test for intent is subjective
-what did d desire?
what did d know?

harm/offense test is objective
- was there physical harm to p
- would a reasonable person find it offensive

*contact must be harmful OR offensive, does not need to be both*

battery law protects interest in bodily interyity; self-determination; right to control one's own body; autonomy and dignity

why hold an insane person accountable? - justice to the victim

single vs dual intent
when we say that the tortfeasor intended to cause a conseuqnce does that mean the tortfeasor necesarily wanted harm or offense ot occur?

single intent- no, defendant only need intend bodily contact that turns OUT to be harmful or offensive

dual intent- yes defendant must intend that contact be harmful or offensive

sept 1

what contact is harmful or offensive?

- bodily harm is any physical impairment of the conditon of another body or physical pain or illness
- bodily contact is offensive if it offends a reasonable sense of personal dignity

Medical personnel behaving badly
Snyder v Turk 

doe v johnson
can sexual contact constitute battery?

can consensual sexual contact constitute battery when someone knows he hs an STD and doesnt iform his partner?
 what degree of defendants knowledge suffices to make a battery case?
 - knows he has an STD
 - knows he has symptoms of an STD
 - knows he has had sexual contact w soeone with an STD
 - knows he has had multiple partners (high risk lifestyle)

what qualifies as contact with plaintiff's "person"?
- anything so connected w the body as to be customarily regarded as part of the other's person

##### Assault 
-element :
1. intent to bring about apprehension of a battery, AND
2. Reasonable apprehension of an imminent battery occurs 

-protects the mind
meaning of imminent? without significant delay 
is apprehension synonymous with fear? - no, plaintiff need not be fearful but need only apprehend an imminent battery. "apprehend" is replaced by "anticipated" in third restatement

##### False imprisonment
-element:
1. Intent to confine
2. Actual confinement
3. Awareness of confinement or actual damages

-freedom of movement protection
how actual confinement can be brought about: overpowering physical force, threat of physical force, actual or apparent barriers


Merchant's privilege to detain
- defense to false imprisonment
- *very limited* 
- reasonable belief plaintiff had taken goods without paying
- detention reasonable for investigation only- does not cover time beyond investigation 
- does not cover bullying or harassment, cannot deny them bathroom
- covers mistakes, however, reasonableness is key *OBJECTIVE STANDARD*- security guard is reasonable in believing shoplifting had occurred, and that confinement is necessary for investigative purchases.
- 

#### Duress of Goods
- subset of false imprisonment cases, arises when an individuals freedom of movement 


#### Parasitic damages & stand-alone emotional harm
- if there is physical harm, accompanying emotional harm is also compensable, as part of p's pain and suffering
- this ki of emotional harm recovery is parasitic to/dependent on the plaintiffs physical harm
- we know mental distress is recoverable on an assult claim 
- issue is whether recovery for emotional harm should be allowed without physical harm or assault (anticipation of imminent battery)

#### Intentional infliction of emotional distress
elements:
1. intent to cause emotional distress 
2. extreme and outrageous conduct (must be directed at plaintiff)
3. severe emotional distress 

** IIED is the only intentional tort where recklessness suffices. Recklessness is defined as a deliberate disregard of a high degree of probability that emotional disress will result
definition of outrageous conduct: exceeding all bounds of common decency, utterly intolerable in a civilized society 

restatement section 46 comment D

outrageous conduct
-typically central issue: did the conduct exceed all bounds of decency?
- courts are not quick to find outrageous conduct (NY in particular has a high threshold)
- insults are not actionable
- 3 fact patterns where courts are more inclined to find the conduct to be sufficiently outrageous:
1. where there has been an abuse of power by a person w authority
2. where defendant knows of plaintiffs particular vulnerability and exploits it
3. where misconduct or harassing behavior is repeated or carried out over a period of time


chanko v ABC (NY 2016)
in ny, liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageious in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. 

brandon v county of richardson (NB 2001)

snyder v phelps (US 2011)
-protest = valid defense


transfer of intent doctrine not applicable to IIED
exceptions:
1. when bystander is a family member that is present & presence is known to defendant
2. when bystander is present and presence is known to defendant and distress results in bodily harm

person must be present to witness the conduct in order to recover
homer v long

#### Defenses to intentional torts

- order of proof: intentional torts & affirmative defenses
- consent and apparent "effective" consent
actual cosnent: consent is effective if p actually did not oppose the conduct
apparent consent: consent is effective if d reasonably believes that p consented 


robins v harris 

kaplan v mamelak 

consent to scope of consent- exceeding the scope of consent

privilege of emergency

consent to crimes

in some states yes, other no

consent by mistake or deception

consent not effective if induced by substantial mistake and defendant knew of the mistake or induced it by misrepresentation
-consent not effective if defendants deception results in an invasion of the kind of interest the tort is intended to protect

hudgens v prosper inc

self defense
-defendant hd reasonable ground for believing they were being attacked
force was reasonable under the circumstances

duty to retreat? generally no unless ur gonna use deadly force

reasonability not important in intentional torts******

recklessness only provides intent in IIED 


While driving his open-bed truck with a friend in the open bed, the driver swerved, throwing his friend to the pavement. The driver’s intent was to play a practical joke on his friend by frightening him. He did not think the friend would actually fall out of the truck. The friend sustained severe injuries. The friend sued the driver for battery to recover damages for his injuries. Will he prevail?

- No, because the driver did not intend to cause a harmful or offensive bodily contact. 
- Yes, because the driver’s conduct was unreasonably risky. 
- **Yes, because the driver intended to frighten him.**
- No, because the friend was not offended.


A smoker and a non-smoker were seated at adjoining tables in a small restaurant. The smoker’s table was in the smoking section, and the nonsmoker’s table was in the nonsmoking section. When the smoker lit a cigarette, the nonsmoker politely requested that he not smoke, explaining that she had a severe allergy to cigarette smoke. The smoker ignored the nonsmoker’s request and continued to smoke. As a result, the nonsmoker was hospitalized with a severe allergic reaction to the smoke. The nonsmoker brought a battery action against the smoker. Which of the following will NOT be an issue in the battery action?

- Does smoke have the physical properties necessary for making the kind of contact required for battery? 
- **Was the smoker’s conduct unreasonable under the circumstances?**
- Did the smoker intend to cause the nonsmoker’s contact with the cigarette smoke? 
- Is contact with cigarette smoke from a lawful smoking section in a restaurant the kind of contact one must endure as a voluntary restaurant patron?


#### Self Defense, Defense of Others, Defense of Property

#### Self defense
elements:
- defendant had reasonable ground for believing they were being attacked
- force was reasonable under the circumstances
---- 
- provocation not a defense
- reasonable force is commensurate with the perceived attack 
- once threat no longer exists, self defense ends
- duty to retreat- generally know unless D is going to use deadly force
- as to deadly force, dependings on jurisdiction 



grimes v saban (ala 2014)

### Defense of Property

katko (iowa 1971)
property owner may not use force capable of causing death or serious bodily harm to prevent trespass to property

brown v martinez (n.m. 1961)

gotarez v smitts (1984)

intentional torts directed at property

## Trespass 

trespass to land
*intent does not need to be to trespass, but to enter. it is enough to be on property even knowing it is not yours*

### trespass to land elements:
1. intent to enter or cause an entry onto land that p has the right to possess
2. unauthorized entry onto the land ("intent to enter" means voluntarily entering, remaining, or leaving something behind)
- plaintiff can be whoever has right to occupy property
- damages: nominal damages available. if d's entry causes physical damage to land p can get damages measure either by cost of repair or diminution in the value of the premises, unless costs to repair are disproportionately larger than the diminished value adnt here is no personal reason for the owner to restore the land to its original condition

***conscious wrongdoing not required.

remaining after permission has been revoked = trespass
even if no damage to land results, still liable for nominal damages


## conversion & tresspass to chattels

conversion:
- intent to exercise dominion or control over the chattel
- serious interference w the owners right to control

chattel:
- intent to intermeddle w the chattle
- actual intermeddling, causing actual damage to the chattel 
- 

conversion- conscious wrongdoing not required
dominion & control


what is personal property?
- body parts?
- intangibles?
- 

defenses to torts directed at property

- public necessity
- a defense to trespass to land, conversion and trespass to chattels when D is acting to protect the public
- -covers reasonable mistakes
- in an emergency threatening person or property of a substantial number of people, one is privileged to trespass and even damage the others property if reasonably necessary
- and the person does not have to pay for any actual damage caused by the act


private necessity
- a defense to trespass to land, conversion & trespass to chattels when d is acting to protect his or her own property or safety
- BUT this is only a partial defense because D must pay for actual harm 

- in an emergency threatening ones own person or property, one is privileged to trespass and even damage the other's property if reasonably necessary
- BUT the person invoking must pay for any actual damage caused by the act


these are PRIVILEGES so:
- if the owner interferes, EEEEEEEEEEEk

negligence
1. duty
	1. misfeasance: if ones conduct creates a risk of harm to others, one has a duty to use reasonable care to prevent harm to others. just about eveyrthing in life creates some risk of harm, so there is usually a duty
	2. nonfeasance: there is no duty to take affirmative action for the benefit of others
2. breach of duty
3. cause in fact/factual causation
4. proximate cause/scope of liability
5. damages

"unless the actor is a child, the standard of conduct to which he must confirm to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable man under like circumstances"
 application to:
 - mental states
 - physical infirmities
 - persons w superior faculties
 - age

stewart v motts (1995)

"the care required is always reasonable care, proportionate always to the danger involved"

posas v horton (2010)

midterm covers intentional torts & general standard of care in negligence claims


## Sudden Incapacitation
- where a persons alleged negligence is caused by a sudden physical incapacitation that is not forseeable to that person, there should be no liability

## Mental states
- "unless the actor is a child, the standard of conduct to which he must confirm to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable man under like circumstances"

#### no mercy
- individual who is habitually wool-gatherings
creasy v rusk

superior faculties

should a person's age be taken into consideration when determining if action was reasonable? 

children- if actor is a child, standard of conduct to which he must conform is to be reasoable of like age & circumstances

-unless child was engaged in a dangerous acctivity normally by adults

thomas v inman

adult standard for gun


analyzing breach:
- statutory negligence per se
- hand formula
- custom
- res ipsa loquitur "thing speaks for itself"

statutory negligence
chaffin v bame
(as a matter of law)

each case must be decided w own peculiar set of facts

criminal law
- govt prosecutes you
- deals w crimes & regulations

civil law
- plaintiff sues you

negligence per se
martin v herzog 

statutes that expressly provide for civil liability- negligence per se doesnt apply
statutes that expressly state that the standard for
determining civil liability? - negligence per se doesnt apply
statutes that make no mention of civil liability? negligence per se may apply

usig crim statutes for tort liability- majority rule
1. duty
2. breach of duty
3. cause in fact
4. prox cause
5. damages

duty arises when forseeable injury comes to a person due to the defendants actions

Rescue doctrine- rescuer is always a forseeable plaintiff- defendant, beside initial defendant, is also liable to those who come to rescue, unless rescuers use unreasonable measures

viable fetus doctrine- a defendant is also liable to a fetus is a pregnant woman is injured. 

determining standard of care: mental illness
for intentional torts- mental illness does not matter 
*unless the actor is a child, his insanity or other mental deficiency does not relieve the d from conduct that does not conform to that of a reasonable person*

people w mental disabilities are commonly held for their negligence tort
HOWEVER 
one employed to take care of a patient known to be combative has no complaint in injuries sustained in doing so. 


statutory negligence RELEVANCE standard
the unexcused violation of a statute is negligence per se if:
1. plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was intended to protect, and
2. the harm suffered by the plaintiff is the type of harm the statute was intended to prevent

analyzing negligence per se (statutory negligence)

-express for civil liabilities
fed regulations
any regulatory bodies

NEGLIGENCE PER SAY BRICK

the process

first judge decides these two questions to determine if statute is relevant:
1. is plaintiff a member of the class of persons the statute was intended to protect?
2. was the harm suffered by the plaintiff the type of harm the statute was intended to prevent?

then: check state law. what is the effect of finding statutory violation?
IF state treats as negligence per se- the plaintiff does not have to prove duty or breach. jury is instructed to find that IF statute was violated, duty & breach elements are met. this is majority of states.

IF state treats as evidence of negligence- the jury is instructed on the regular reasonable person standard and is free to find that the statute violation either does or does not 

getchell v lodge (2003)
plaintiffs argument: d violated statuses prohibiting crossing a center line of traffic. try the statutory negligence analysis. 


## hand formula 

negligence = B < PL
B = burden of preventing the harm
P = probability of harm
L = gravity of harm (loss)



us v carroll towing
- what precautions could d take?
- should d have taken that precaution?
- burden of taking precaution: cost of having bargee on board
- probability of harm: probability of barge breaking away and causing loss or damage
- loss if not taken: expected loss if barge does break away 

"precaution should be taken until a penny more spent to prevent accidents yields less than a pennys reduction in expected accident costs"
- gregory c keating 

the untaken precaution
how much would it have cost to take the precaution? (B = burden of taking precaution)

what is the foreseeable cost of failing to take the precaution?
p = prob of harm if precaution not taken
L = amount of harm if precaution not taken

mcczrty v pheasant run, inc 
untaken precaution
third restatement

### Res Ipsa Loquitur 

customs- custom is not an absolute defense to negligence- tj hooper (learned hand)
byrne v boadle

elements of res ipsa loquitur-
1. ordinarily this event doesnt happen absent negligence
2. injury was caused by an agent or instrumentality within the (exclusive?) control of the defendant
differently expressed: the negligence is more likely than not attributable to the defendant
3. plaintiff was not contributorily negligent

procedural effect of res ipsa loquitor- *raises an interference of negligence*

MAJORITY RULE- res ipra loquitor permits inference of negligence: jury is permitted (but not required) to find defendant negligent if the jury finds that the plaintiff has proved the elements of res ipsa loquitor

MINORITY: rebuttable presumption of negligence created
if jury finds that plaintiff has proved the elements of res ipsa loquitor, defendant must be presumed negligent. defendant can rebut this resumption with evidence that it was not negligent. 

damages must always be proved in negligence case-- 

STATUTORY NEGLIGENCE:
- REASONABLE PERSON STANDARD- the standard of a reasonably prudent individual under same/similar circumstances would follow
- SUPERIOR FACULTIES STANDARD- would reasonable individual w superior faculties act the same way under the same/similar circumstances
- PHYSICAL DISABILITY STANDARD- did the individual act the way one with a similar disability would under the circumstances
- CHILD STANDARD- would a reasonable child of the same age, intelligence & experience act the same way under the same circumstances?
- EXCEPTION- a child is engaging in adult activities (ex; operating cars)

nov 3rd
negligence- cause in fact!

cause in fact
-BUT FOR defendants negligent conduct, plaintiff would not have suffered the harm
but for = were it not for =without

ex ante
ex post

"by cause in fact"

but for defendants negligent conduct, plaintiff would not have suffered the harm
[but for =were it not for = without]

there can be more than one but for cause in an injury 

two persons causing sep divisible injuries- causal apportionment
in some inu

----
but for defendants negligent conduct, plaintiff would nothave suffered the harm
works p well most of the time
there can be more than one


alternative liability
when there are multiple ds but only one caused plaintiffs harm, the burdne shifts to the defendants to show lack of causation if
a0 all defendants were negligent (breached duty to care
b)
c

summers v tice 1948


market share theory


The test used in a majority of jurisdictions to determine proximate cause asks . . . 

A.whether defendant’s negligent conduct was a direct cause of plaintiff’s harm.

B. whether plaintiff’s injury was a foreseeable consequence of defendant’s negligence.

Proximate cause is essentially a policy question: How far should liability reach? 

•To determine if plaintiff’s harm was “foreseeable,” identify the unreasonable risk that made the act negligent.  Did plaintiff suffer the type of harm associated with defendant’s act?

•Key is foreseeability!!!

3 Scope of Liability Questions

•Unforeseeable Consequence? 

–Ask:  Is consequence typical?  Freakish? Somewhere in the middle?

•Unforeseeable Plaintiff? See Palsgraf

•Intervening Conduct that supersedes original tortfeasor’s liability?

An actor’s liability is limited to those physical harms that result from the risks that made the actor’s conduct tortious.”  Rest 3d Torts § 29.

•____________________ was negligent because it created an unreasonable risk of _____________________.

•If what is in the second blank is what happened, there is proximate cause.

3 scope of liability questions:
- unforseeable consequence- match risk created to the harm that P suffered
- unforseeable plaintiff
- intervening conduct that superscedes original tortfeasors liability

a D is liable for torts and crimes of others IF
- potential exposure to harm is a risk that makes D's conduct tortious, OR
- D knew or should have known negligence would expose P to danger
