torts- wrongs recognized by law as grounds for a lawsuit

defendant at fault because he intends harm or acts unreasonable to risk harm

element- all must be proven
a requirement must be proven to support cause of action or affirmative defense

cause of action- claim against a person who committed the tort (specific wrong) if proven, gives P right to remedy

tort liability:
1. intentional torts
2. negligence
3. strict liability

sources of tort law:
1. statutes
2. common law

goals of system:
1. detterence
2. compensate victims

prima facie case-specific elements  plaintiff proves to support a cause of action
affirmative defense-releases D from liability despite P proving prima facie case

restatements are an attempt to SUMMARIZE the common law- does not reflect current state of the law

reasonability is an OBJECtiVE test for judge/jury to execute

rationale for strict liabiity?
- encourage greater investment in safety. reasonable care isnt enough
- consumers do not have time nor expertise to evaluate products correctly
- proof problems- negligence difficult to prove, strict liability allows consumer better chance of recovery
- cost spreading- defects are bound to happen, companies can build payouts into their budget

damages- medical bills, lost wages, pain & suffering

showing INTENT
1. wanted to cause harm
2. substantial certainty harm will come
3. transfer of intent

intent
- known danger causes to be only a foreseeable risk which a reasonable person would avoid & becomes in the mind of the actor a substantial certainty

intent is a SUBJECTIVE standard

vs 

negligence
- conduct creates an unreasonable risk of harm

reasonability is an OBJECTIVE standard

transfer of intent
- tort to tort
- victim to victim

##### intentional torts
what does intent mean?

intentional torts
- battery
- assault
- false imprisonment
- intention infliction of emotional distress
- trespass to land
- trespass to chattels
- conversion

affirmative defenses
- consent
- self defense & defense of others
- private necessity
- public necessity

intent generally means an intent to cause some consequence

- an act is "intentional" if the actor
	1. WANTED to cause the consequence OR
	2. KNEW the consequence was substantially certain to result OR
	3. TRANSFERRED intent applies

battery- to make prima facie case, the plaintiff must show that defendant intentionally caused a harmful or offensive contact with the person of plaintiff
-protects personal dignity & body
- intent
	- to satisfy the intent for battery, p must show that D wanted, knew, or transferred intent to cause harm 
- harmful or offensive contact
	- a contact is harmful is
	- a contact is offensive if
- with plaintiff's person


a matter of perspective
test for intent is subjective
-what did d desire?
what did d know?

harm/offense test is objective
- was there physical harm to p
- would a reasonable person find it offensive

*contact must be harmful OR offensive, does not need to be both*

battery law protects interest in bodily interyity; self-determination; right to control one's own body; autonomy and dignity

why hold an insane person accountable? - justice to the victim

single vs dual intent
when we say that the tortfeasor intended to cause a conseuqnce does that mean the tortfeasor necesarily wanted harm or offense ot occur?

single intent- no, defendant only need intend bodily contact that turns OUT to be harmful or offensive

dual intent- yes defendant must intend that contact be harmful or offensive

sept 1

what contact is harmful or offensive?

- bodily harm is any physical impairment of the conditon of another body or physical pain or illness
- bodily contact is offensive if it offends a reasonable sense of personal dignity

Medical personnel behaving badly
Snyder v Turk 

doe v johnson
can sexual contact constitute battery?

can consensual sexual contact constitute battery when someone knows he hs an STD and doesnt iform his partner?
 what degree of defendants knowledge suffices to make a battery case?
 - knows he has an STD
 - knows he has symptoms of an STD
 - knows he has had sexual contact w soeone with an STD
 - knows he has had multiple partners (high risk lifestyle)

what qualifies as contact with plaintiff's "person"?
- anything so connected w the body as to be customarily regarded as part of the other's person

##### Assault 
-element :
1. intent to bring about apprehension of a battery, AND
2. Reasonable apprehension of an imminent battery occurs 

-protects the mind
meaning of imminent? without significant delay 
is apprehension synonymous with fear? - no, plaintiff need not be fearful but need only apprehend an imminent battery. "apprehend" is replaced by "anticipated" in third restatement

##### False imprisonment
-element:
1. Intent to confine
2. Actual confinement
3. Awareness of confinement or actual damages

-freedom of movement protection
how actual confinement can be brought about: overpowering physical force, threat of physical force, actual or apparent barriers


Merchant's privilege to detain
- 

#### Duress of Goods
- subset of false imprisonment cases, arises when an individuals freedom of movement 


#### Parasitic damages & stand-alone emotional harm
- if there is physical harm, accompanying emotional harm is also compensable, as part of p's pain and suffering
- this ki of emotional harm recovery is parasitic to/dependent on the plaintiffs physical harm
- we know mental distress is recoverable on an assult claim 
- issue is whether recovery for emotional harm should be allowed without physical harm or assault (anticipation of imminent battery)

#### Intentional infliction of emotional distress
elements:
1. intent to cause emotional distress 
2. extreme and outrageous conduct (must be directed at plaintiff)
3. severe emotional distress 

** IIED is the only intentional tort where recklessness suffices. Recklessness is defined as a deliberate disregard of a high degree of probability that emotional disress will result
definition of outrageous conduct: exceeding all bounds of common decency, utterly intolerable in a civilized society 

restatement section 46 comment D

outrageous conduct
-typically central issue: did the conduct exceed all bounds of decency?
- courts are not quick to find outrageous conduct (NY in particular has a high threshold)
- insults are not actionable
- 3 fact patterns where courts are more inclined to find the conduct to be sufficiently outrageous:
1. where there has been an abuse of power by a person w authority
2. where defendant knows of plaintiffs particular vulnerability and exploits it
3. where misconduct or harassing behavior is repeated or carried out over a period of time


chanko v ABC (NY 2016)
in ny, liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageious in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. 

brandon v county of richardson (NB 2001)

snyder v phelps (US 2011)
-protest = valid defense


transfer of intent doctrine not applicable to IIED
exceptions:
1. when bystander is a family member that is present & presence is known to defendant
2. when bystander is present and presence is known to defendant and distress results in bodily harm

person must be present to witness the conduct in order to recover
homer v long

#### Defenses to intentional torts

- order of proof: intentional torts & affirmative defenses
- consent and apparent "effective" consent
actual cosnent: consent is effective if p actually did not oppose the conduct
apparent consent: consent is effective if d reasonably believes that p consented 


robins v harris 

kaplan v mamelak 

consent to scope of consent- exceeding the scope of consent

privilege of emergency

consent to crimes

in some states yes, other no

consent by mistake or deception

consent not effective if induced by substantial mistake and defendant knew of the mistake or induced it by misrepresentation
-consent not effective if defendants deception results in an invasion of the kind of interest the tort is intended to protect

hudgens v prosper inc

self defense
-defendant hd reasonable ground for believing they were being attacked
force was reasonable under the circumstances

duty to retreat? generally no unless ur gonna use deadly force

reasonability not important in intentional torts******

recklessness only provides intent in IIED 


While driving his open-bed truck with a friend in the open bed, the driver swerved, throwing his friend to the pavement. The driver’s intent was to play a practical joke on his friend by frightening him. He did not think the friend would actually fall out of the truck. The friend sustained severe injuries. The friend sued the driver for battery to recover damages for his injuries. Will he prevail?

- No, because the driver did not intend to cause a harmful or offensive bodily contact. 
- Yes, because the driver’s conduct was unreasonably risky. 
- **Yes, because the driver intended to frighten him.**
- No, because the friend was not offended.


A smoker and a non-smoker were seated at adjoining tables in a small restaurant. The smoker’s table was in the smoking section, and the nonsmoker’s table was in the nonsmoking section. When the smoker lit a cigarette, the nonsmoker politely requested that he not smoke, explaining that she had a severe allergy to cigarette smoke. The smoker ignored the nonsmoker’s request and continued to smoke. As a result, the nonsmoker was hospitalized with a severe allergic reaction to the smoke. The nonsmoker brought a battery action against the smoker. Which of the following will NOT be an issue in the battery action?

- Does smoke have the physical properties necessary for making the kind of contact required for battery? 
- **Was the smoker’s conduct unreasonable under the circumstances?**
- Did the smoker intend to cause the nonsmoker’s contact with the cigarette smoke? 
- Is contact with cigarette smoke from a lawful smoking section in a restaurant the kind of contact one must endure as a voluntary restaurant patron?


#### Self Defense, Defense of Others, Defense of Property

#### Self defense
elements:
- defendant had reasonable ground for believing they were being attacked
- force was reasonable under the circumstances
---- 
- provocation not a defense
- reasonable force is commensurate with the perceived attack 
- once threat no longer exists, self defense ends
- duty to retreat- generally know unless D is going to use deadly force
- as to deadly force, dependings on jurisdiction 


grimes v saban (ala 2014) 

9/20/22

### Defense of Property

katko (iowa 1971)
property owner may not use force capable of causing death or serious bodily harm to prevent trespass to property

brown v martinez (n.m. 1961)

gotarez v smitts (1984)

intentional torts directed at property

## Trespass 

trespass to land
*intent does not need to be to trespass, but to enter. it is enough to be on property even knowing it is not yours*

### trespass to land elements:
1. intent to enter or cause an entry onto land that p has the right to possess
2. unauthorized entry onto the land ("intent to enter" means voluntarily entering, remaining, or leaving something behind)
- plaintiff can be whoever has right to occupy property
- damages: nominal damages available. if d's entry causes physical damage to land p can get damages measure either by cost of repair or diminution in the value of the premises, unless costs to repair are disproportionately larger than the diminished value adnt here is no personal reason for the owner to restore the land to its original condition

***conscious wrongdoing not required.

remaining after permission has been revoked = trespass
even if no damage to land results, still liable for nominal damages


## conversion & tresspass to chattels

conversion:
- intent to exercise dominion or control over the chattel
- serious interference w the owners right to control

chattel:
- intent to intermeddle w the chattle
