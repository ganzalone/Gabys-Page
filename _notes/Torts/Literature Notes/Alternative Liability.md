When there are multiple defendants but only one caused the plaintiff's harm, the burden shifts to the defendants to show lack of causation if:
1. all of the defendants were negligent (each breached a duty of care)
2. all of the defendants are equally likely to have caused plaintiff's harm, and
3. it is impossible to know which defendant caused plaintiff's harm


- number of negligent parties: more than one
- number of parties who contributed to plaintiff's harm: one
