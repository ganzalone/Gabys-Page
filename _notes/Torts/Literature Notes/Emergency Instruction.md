Are some situations covered by the "under the circumstances" language of the reasonable care standard? Heck yeah lots of courts agree. 

Third Restatement: "if an actor is confronted with an unexpected emergency requiring rapid response, this is a circumstance to be taken into account is determining whether the actor's resulting conduct is that of the reasonably careful person"

What counts as an emergency?- A sudden, unexpected and unforeseen happening or condition that calls for immediate action, that was not created by the party asserting the emergency.
