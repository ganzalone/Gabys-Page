Created: 2022-09-17 14:49

## Elements:
1. Intent to confine
	- within boundaries fixed by the actor or intentionally preventing another from going in a particular direction, taking something of need, the deprivation would cause you to act unreasonably
	- duress- threats of imminent force
	- barriers against plaintiffs' loved ones, property
2. Actual confinement
	- overpowering physical force, threat of physical force, actual or apparent barriers
	- an exclusion is once the confined area is on a grander scale- does not have to be a small area
	- an exclusion can be actual confinement 
3. Awareness of confinement or actual damages
	- no liability unless person knows *OR* is harmed
	- there are particular exceptions ex: locking baby (unaware) in a bank vault & baby suffers. 

- transportation of a victim with the actor is considered the same as keeping them in a small room
- **refusal to release or aid in escape**- if actor is under duty to release or assist in escape, if it sufficient for false imprisonment

what is NOT false imprisonment?
- moral threats are not false imprisonment
- no knowledge or harm of imprisonment 

[[**Merchant's privilege to detain**]]- reasonable confinement
