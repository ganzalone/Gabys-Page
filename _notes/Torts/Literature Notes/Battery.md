### Elements of battery:
1. Intent (subjective test. inquiry into D's desires)
	- to satisfy the intent for battery, p must show that D wanted, knew, or transferred intent to cause harm 
2. Harmful or offensive contact (objective test. physical harm/offensive to a reasonable person)-was the contact unpermitted?
	- a contact is harmful OR
	- a contact is offensive 
	- hypersensitivity- in the case of hypersensitivity, we must ask if the defendant knew about this sensitivity regarding the plaintiff and proceeded to commit the act anyway
3. With plaintiff's person
	- anything so connected with the body as to be customarily regarded as part of the other's person. Bodily harm is any physical impairment of the other's body, or physical pain or illness. 

- **insanity is not a defense**


### Single vs Dual intent jurisdictions
Did the tortfeasor necessarily want harm or offense to occur?

1. Single intent- Defendant only need to intend bodily contact that turns OUT to be harmful or offensive
2. Dual intent- Defendant must intend contact to be harmful or offensive to be guilty


- defendant is liable for damages concerning incident and foreseeable damages
