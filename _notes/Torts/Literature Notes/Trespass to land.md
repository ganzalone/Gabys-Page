Created: 2022-10-12 16:48

*intent does not need to be to trespass, but to enter. it is enough to be on property even knowing it is not yours*

## Elements:
1. intent to enter or cause an entry onto land that p has the right to possess
2. unauthorized entry onto the land ("intent to enter" means voluntarily entering, remaining, or leaving something behind)
- plaintiff can be whoever has right to occupy property
- damages: nominal damages available. if d's entry causes physical damage to land p can get damages measure either by cost of repair or diminution in the value of the premises, unless costs to repair are disproportionately larger than the diminished value and there is no personal reason for the owner to restore the land to its original condition

***conscious wrongdoing not required.

remaining after permission has been revoked = trespass
even if no damage to land results, still liable for nominal damages
