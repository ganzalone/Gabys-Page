The test used in a majority of jurisdictions to determine proximate cause asks . . . 
	1. whether defendant’s negligent conduct was a direct cause of plaintiff’s harm.
	2.  whether plaintiff’s injury was a foreseeable consequence of defendant’s negligence.

Proximate cause is essentially a policy question: How far should liability reach? 

To determine if plaintiff’s harm was “foreseeable,” identify the unreasonable risk that made the act negligent.  Did plaintiff suffer the type of harm associated with defendant’s act? See [[Foreseeability]]

##### 3 Scope of Liability Questions

•Unforeseeable Consequence? 
	Ask:  Is consequence typical?  Freakish? Somewhere in the middle?

•Unforeseeable Plaintiff? 
	See [[Palsgraf v. LIRR (1928)]]

•Intervening Conduct that supersedes original tortfeasor’s liability?

-------------

•____________________ was negligent because it created an unreasonable risk of _____________________

•If what is in the second blank is what happened, there is proximate cause.

*when is an act unreasonable?*- an act is negligent if it poses an unreasonable risk of causing harm

------

duty and proximate cause are two sides of the same coin: the scope of one's duty is limited by the scope of foreseeable consequences.
Thus, when we consider the "risks" we look to the TYPE OF HARM associated with the negligence (see example in [[Foreseeability]])
*who is a foreseeable plaintiff is also considered*
