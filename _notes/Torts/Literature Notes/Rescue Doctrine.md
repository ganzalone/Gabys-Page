Are subsequent negligent acts by rescuers or medical superseding?
- If the defendant caused bodily harm to plaintiff, defendant is liable for harm negligently caused by rescuers and medical personnel who are trying to help plaintiff (Rest. 2nd Torts Sec. 457)
- BUT defendant is not liable or extraodinary misconduct by such persons

"danger invites a rescue" therefore it is foreseeable that other plaintiffs may get hurt trying to help the people the defendant injured.

If defendant negligent injured plaintiff, some subsequent consequences will be treated as "foreseeble":
- injuries to rescuers trying to help plaintiff
- further injury to plaintiff caused by the negligence of rescuers and medical personnel trying to help
- further injury to plaintiff sustained while recovering *(usually forseeable)*
- further injury to plaintiff caused by torts and crimes of third parties *(sometimes foreseeable)*
