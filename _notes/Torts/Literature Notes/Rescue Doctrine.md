Are subsequent negligent acts by rescuers or medical superseding?
- If the defendant caused bodily harm to plaintiff, defendant is liable for harm negligently caused by rescuers and medical personnel who are trying to help plaintiff (Rest. 2nd Torts Sec. 457)
- BUT defendant is not liable for extraodinary misconduct by such persons

"danger invites a rescue" therefore it is foreseeable that other plaintiffs may get hurt trying to help the people the defendant injured.

If defendant negligent injured plaintiff, some subsequent consequences will be treated as "foreseeble":
- injuries to rescuers trying to help plaintiff
- further injury to plaintiff caused by the negligence of rescuers and medical personnel trying to help
- further injury to plaintiff sustained while recovering *(usually forseeable)*
- further injury to plaintiff caused by torts and crimes of third parties *(sometimes foreseeable)*


However, some jurisdictions limit the rescue doctrine to just Good Samaritans, meaning that the rescue doctrine applies only if the rescuer is engaging in a gratuitous attempt at rescue as a humanitarian gesture. These jurisdictions generally do not apply the rescue doctrine to rescuers who are under a legal or contractual obligation to attempt a rescue, like a policeman, fireman, or EMT.
