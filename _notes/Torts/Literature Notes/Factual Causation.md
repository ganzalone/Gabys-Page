BUT FOR the defendant's negligent conduct, the plaintiff would not have suffered the harm.
- buf for = were it not for = without

to count as a factual cause under the but-for test, the plaintiff must prove that her harm would not have occurred had the defendant not acted negligently. In other words, factual cause is not established if the plaintiff's harm would have occurred even if the defendant had acted non-negligently. 

But for the defendant's (negligence) would the plaintiff have suffered (harm)?

### Steps!

1. Apply but-for causation for each party
	- look at the likelihood the defendant caused the harm, not the *amount* of harm defendant caused
	- there can be more than one but-for cause
2. Was there more than one cause of an indivisible injury?
	- If yes, apply the [[Substantial Factor]]
3. If there is only one cause, but multiple defendants, apply the *Summers* rule ([[alternative liability]])
	- all of the defendants were negligent,
	- all of the defendants are equally likely to have caused the plaintiff's harm, and
	- it is impossible to know which defendant caused plaintiff's harm.
