 The majority of jurisdictions require that the actor owe a duty to the particular, foreseeable victim, not to everyone in the world. Thus, to establish the duty element of a negligence claim in the majority of jurisdictions, a victim must prove that the actor owed that particular victim a duty under the law, and the actor’s duty was to not act negligently in those circumstances. 
 
 In contrast, the minority view is that a duty to one is a duty to all. Under the minority view, if an actor is careless and someone is hurt, the duty element is satisfied.



Physical harm is always prima facie harm. Physical harm includes the physical impairment of the human body, like a physical injury, illness, disease, impairment of bodily function, or death. However, in an ordinary negligence case, mere emotional harm, without any accompanying physical injury, is not a prima facie harm. Rather, emotional harm is typically recoverable only if the victim can show a related physical harm that will support bringing the negligence claim in the first place.

Physical harm includes both bodily harm and property damage that causes some sort of economic loss
Although economic loss alone is generally not prima facie harm in a typical negligence case, here, where the lawsuit is based on professional negligence (malpractice), economic loss is sufficient.


The concurrent-causes test for actual causation applies if: (1) multiple acts or forces combined to cause an injury, and (2) none of the forces alone would have been sufficient to cause the injury.

 if a person undertakes, gratuitously or for compensation, an act that a reasonable person should recognize as necessary for the protection of another person (or that person’s property), then the helping person has undertaken a duty of care and may be liable for any injury caused by the helper’s failure to exercise reasonable care while performing that voluntary protective act. Further, under this voluntary-promise rule, the helper’s asserted negligence may be a typical affirmative act, but it may also be a failure to act in some situations. Specifically, if both: (1) the helper voluntarily promised or otherwise took on a protective task and (2) the recipient reasonably relied on the helper’s promise or actions undertaking the protective task, then the voluntary helper will have a duty to affirmatively act to perform that protective task—and the helper’s mere inaction or nonfeasance may be considered negligent.
