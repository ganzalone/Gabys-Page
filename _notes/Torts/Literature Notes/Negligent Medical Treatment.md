when negligent medical treatment exacerbates harm caused by original tortfeasor:
- doctor should not be liable for the full injuries, only for the aggravation of those injuries
- Restatement Second provides that the original tortfeasor remains responsible for the entire harm even when a portion of that harm was caused by subsequent medical care. 
- Thus if joint and several liability applied, the original tortfeasor would be liable for the entire harm; the doctor would be liable only for the aggravation-but liability for that latter portion would be joint
- Thus if the doctor were insolvent, the original tortfeasor would be liable for the entire harm. If the original tortfeasor were insolvent, the doctor would be liable only for a portion of the harm, not the entire harm- becuse the doctor did not factually cause the original injury.
