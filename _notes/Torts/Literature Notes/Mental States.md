 "unless the actor is a child, the standard of conduct to which he must confirm to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable man under like circumstances"

### No Mercy!

"the individual who is habitually wool-gathering and inattentive, absent-minded, forgetful, ignorant or inexperienced, slow-witted, stupid, or a fool, must conform to the standards of the society in which he lives, or if he cannot conform to them must still make good the damage he does"

Note: One employed to take care of an individual with mental incapacities known to be combative has no complaint for injuries sustained. 

Mentally ill defendant can be held liable unless the def can show a sudden occurrence of mental illness that would demonstrate incapacitation. 


However, **one exception** to this general rule is if the defendant can show that he has a genuine mental disability, especially one linked to a biological or physiological cause, like a traumatic brain injury. Because the reasonable man is deemed to have the same physical characteristics as the defendant, if the defendant has a physical condition or disease that causes a mental disability, then that disability should be considered when determining what a reasonable man is for that case.
