Created: 2022-09-17 15:38

## Elements:
1. intent to cause emotional distress 
	- **only intentional tort where recklessness suffices.** Recklessness is defined as a deliberate disregard of a high degree of probability that emotional distress will result
	- 
2. extreme and outrageous conduct (must be directed at the plaintiff)
	- outrageous conduct defined as exceeding all bounds of common decency, utterly intolerable in a civilized society 
	- courts are not quick to find outrageous conduct (NY in particular has a high threshold)
	- insults are not actionable. insults are comments that fall short of outrage. HOWEVER if they are continuous, they can qualify as outrageous.-especially type of plaintiff (insulting a young child or pregnant woman) or defendant (public service workers, someone in the care of the plaintiff)
	- more inclined fact patterns:
	1. where there has been an abuse of power by a person with authority
	2. where the defendant knows of the plaintiff's particular vulnerability and exploits it
	3. where misconduct or harassing behavior is repeated or carried out over a period of time
3. severe emotional distress occurs

**transfer of intent doctrine not applicable to IIED
EXCEPT:
1. when bystander is a family member that is present & presence is known to defendant
2. when bystander is **present and presence is known to defendant** and distress results in bodily harm
