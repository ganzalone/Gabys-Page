property owner may not use force capable of causing death or serious bodily harm to prevent trespass to property

## Public Necessity 

 a defense to trespass to land, conversion and trespass to chattels when D is acting to protect the public
- covers reasonable mistakes
- in an emergency threatening person or property of a substantial number of people, one is privileged to trespass and even damage the others property if reasonably necessary
- and the person **does not have to pay** for any actual damage caused by the act


## Private Necessity 

 a defense to trespass to land, conversion & trespass to chattels when d is acting to protect his or her own property or safety
- BUT this is only a partial defense because D must pay for actual harm 

- in an emergency threatening *ones own* person or property, one is privileged to trespass and even damage the other's property if reasonably necessary
- BUT the person invoking **must pay** for any actual damage caused by the act

However, the privilege to trespass under a claim of private necessity only lasts as long as the danger lasts. Further, under a private-necessity defense, the trespasser must still pay for any property damage caused by the trespass, even if the damage was necessary to protect the trespasser.

These are PRIVILEGES, so
- if the owner interferes, the owner is liable for the harm he causes, and
- the person invoking can defend herself and property from the owner
- BUT: you cannot invoke these privileges if you caused the emergency.
