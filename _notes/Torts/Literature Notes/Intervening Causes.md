Causes of Plaintiffs harm - intervening causes - superseding causes

-defendant is liable even when there are intervening causes UNLESS the intervening cause is unforeseeable and therefore "superseding", thus breaking the causal chain. 

### General rule:
a defendant is liable for the harm caused by torts and crimes of others if:
1. potential exposure to such harm is one of the risks that makes defendant's conduct tortious, or
2. defendant knew or should have known his negligence would expose plaintiff to an increased risk of such conduct.

### Intervening criminal acts

"when an actor is found liable precisely because of the failure to adopt adequate precaution against the risk of harm of another's acts or omissions, or by an extraordinary force of nature, there is no scope of liability limitation on the actor's liability"
