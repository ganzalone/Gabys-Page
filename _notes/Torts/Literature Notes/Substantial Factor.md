Under the substantial factor test, a defendant may be held liable for all of plaintiff's damages despite there being another cause of plaintiff's damages if defendant's negligence could have by itself been sufficient to cause plaintiff's damages

"would (negligence) have been sufficient **by itself** to cause (harm)?""

- number of negligent parties- more than one
- number of parties who contributed to plaintiffs harm- more than one
