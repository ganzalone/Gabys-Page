"the thing speaks for itself"

## Elements
1. ordinarily this event doesnt happen absent negligence
2. injury was caused by an agent or instrumentality within the (exclusive?) control of the defendant
*differently expressed: the negligence is more likely than not attributable to the defendant
3. plaintiff was not contributorily negligent

procedural effect of res ipsa loquitor- *raises an interference of negligence*

MAJORITY RULE- res ipsa loquitor permits inference of negligence: 
- jury is permitted (but not required) to find defendant negligent if the jury finds that the plaintiff has proved the elements of res ipsa loquitor

MINORITY: rebuttable presumption of negligence created:
- if jury finds that plaintiff has proved the elements of res ipsa loquitor, defendant must be presumed negligent. defendant can rebut this resumption with evidence that it was not negligent.
