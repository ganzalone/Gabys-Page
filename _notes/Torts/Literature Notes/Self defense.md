## Elements:
1. defendant had reasonable grounds for believing they were being attacked.
2. force used in defense must be reasonable under the circumstances

- provocation is not a defense
- reasonable force is commensurate with the perceived attack 
- **once threat no longer exists, self-defense ends
- Duty to retreat is generally non-existent unless the defendant is going to use deadly force. In that case, it is dependent on the jurisdiction
- use of excessive force waives right to self defense

- mistake- D, if made a mistake about apprehending a danger, is entitled to self-defense if they reasonably apprehend that violence is about to occur, and that the method used is reasonable
