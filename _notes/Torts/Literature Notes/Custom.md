In a negligence action, evidence of what is customarily done in the relevant industry is admissible. 

Custom is not an absolute defense to negligence, however custom may provide evidence of whether D was negligent. 

Exception to this general rule: 
Professionals are held to the standard of other professionals in the same field and specialty.

Jury instruction- "failure to comply with local customary standard may be considered on the question of whether or not the D was negligent"
