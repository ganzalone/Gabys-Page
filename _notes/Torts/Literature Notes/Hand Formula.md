negligence = B < PL
B = burden of preventing the harm
P = probability of harm
L = gravity of harm (loss)

"precaution should be taken until a penny more spent to prevent accidents yields less than a pennys reduction in expected accident costs"
 --gregory c keating 

the untaken precaution
how much would it have cost to take the precaution? (B = burden of taking precaution)

what is the foreseeable cost of failing to take the precaution?
p = probability of harm if precaution not taken
L = amount of harm if precaution not taken

Third Restatement:
in analyzing whether conduct is negligent, the major factors are "the foreseeable likelihood that the person's conduct will result in harm, the foreseeable severity of any harm that may ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm"

(foreseeable risk: the risk of harm is unreasonable when a reasonable and prudent person would foresee that harm might result and would avoid conduct that creates the risk)
