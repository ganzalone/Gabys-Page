Standards:
1. Reasonable Person
2. Superior Faculties
3. Physical Disability
4. Age

Statutes that count for negligence per se:
- federal statutes
- state statutes
- city ordinances*
- administrative regulations*
(some states like NY treat violation of an ordinance or regulation as only evidence of negligence)

- statutes that expressly provide for civil liability- negligence per se doesnt apply
- statutes that expressly state that the standard for determining civil liability? - negligence per se doesnt apply
- statutes that make no mention of civil liability? negligence per se may apply

the unexcused violation of a statute is negligence per se if:
1. plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was intended to protect, **and**
2. harm suffered by plaintiff is the kind of harm the statute was intended to prevent

Excuses from Restatements Second 288A
- incapacity to comply
- ignorance of the occasion for compliance
- inability to comply after a reasonable attempt to do so
- emergency not caused by the person accused of misconduct
- compliance would put the person at greater risk of harm

The Negligence per se Process:
to determine if statute is relevant, we ask
1. is plaintiff a member of the class of persons the statute was intended to protect?
2. was the harm suffered by the plaintiff the kind of harm the statute was intended to prevent?


**JUDGE decides standard of care**
THEN, what is the effect of finding statutory violation?

1. IF state treats as negligence per se, the plaintiff does not have to prove duty or breach. Jury is instructed to find that IF statute was violated, duty and breach elements are met. This is majority of states.
2. IF state treats as evidence of negligence- the jury is instructed on the regular reasonable person standard and is free to find that the statute violation either does or does not violate that standard.
