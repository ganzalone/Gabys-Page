general rule for children: "if the actor is a child, the standard of conduct to which he must conform to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable person of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances"

**exception**: a child will be held to the standard for an adult if 
1. the child was engaged in a dangerous activity and 
2. the activity is normally only engaged in by adults

general rule for adults: adults are held to standard of a reasonable person regardless of old age

Unless an actor is a child, the actor’s insanity or other mental deficiency is not incorporated into the standard of care. _Id._ § 283B.
