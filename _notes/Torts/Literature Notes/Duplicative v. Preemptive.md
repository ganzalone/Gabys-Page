Duplicative cause: If two seperate causes are sufficient enough to have created the tortious harm on their own, and would have done so regardless of the other force, these causes are "duplicative" causes

Preemptive cause: Ex: Tortfeasor 1 poisons victim's tea. As victim is about to drink the tea, Tortfeasor 2 shoots the victim dead. Victim died by gunshot, not poison. Tortfeasor 1's conduct is not a cause in fact.
