*1 Queen’s Bench 346 (1892)*

Plaintiff(s):
Defendant(s):

### Procedural history:

### Facts:
Humble transferred his tavern to some brewers (defendants), but stayed on to manage the tavern after the transfer. Humble’s name remained painted on the tavern and the tavern license continued in his name. The transfer agreement gave most of the purchasing authority to the brewers. Humble was authorized to purchase ales and mineral water exclusively for the tavern. However, for several years after the transfer, Humble bought cigars, Bovril, a salty meat extract, and other supplies on credit to be sold at the tavern. The supplier (plaintiff) sued the brewers to collect for the price of the supplies Humble purchased. At trial, the brewers argued that since they limited Humble’s purchasing power and did not hold him out as their agent, Humble lacked authority to purchase the forbidden supplies and they should not be liable to pay for them. The trial court held that the brewers were liable to pay for the cigars and Bovril because Humble was acting as tavern manager when he purchased those items, which were typically sold in taverns.

### Rule of law:
A principal is liable for the acts of an agent who proceeds within the scope of authority typically given to an agent with similar duties, regardless of limitations the principal imposes on that agent.

### Issue:
Is a principal bound by an agent’s unauthorized actions in the course of duty when the agent does not disclose the identity of the principal to a third party with whom the agent contracts.

### Holding:
Yes. An undisclosed principal who employs an agent to run a business is liable to third parties who contract with the agent for transactions typical in the line of business, even if the agent’s actions violate an agreement between the agent and principal.

### Rationale:
 While the brewers are the owners of the tavern, they allowed it to remain in Humble’s name and employed Humble to manage it. Although the brewers did not hold out Humble as their agent and remained undisclosed to the suppliers, under these circumstances Humble appeared to have authority to engage in transactions on behalf of the business. Humble’s purchase of items normally sold in taverns, cigars and Bovril, were within the reasonable scope of an agent acting on behalf of a tavern owner. The supplier had no knowledge of Humble’s limited purchasing authority, but rather had every reason to believe that Humble had authority to buy supplies for the tavern. 
 
### Judgment:
Judgment of the lower court is affirmed, and the brewers are liable to pay for the cigars and Bovril purchased by Humble.
