*57 IDAHO 792 (1937)*

Plaintiff(s):
Defendant(s):

### Procedural history:
September 1935-  action commenced by R. S. Gorton (Father) to recover medical expenses incurred by Father and Richard Gorton (Son) in an accident. 
Trial- jury in favor of Father for $870 and another in favor of  Son for $5,000. Separate judgments were then entered upon such verdicts. Motion for new trial was made and denied. Cases on appeal, order denying new trial. 

### Facts:
Richard Gorton, a minor, was a junior in the Soda Springs High School and a member of the football team; that his high school team and the Paris High School team were scheduled to play a game of football at Paris on the 21st. Appellant was teaching at the Soda Springs High School and Russell Garst was coaching the Soda Springs team. On the day the game was played, the Soda Springs High School team was transported to and from Paris in privately owned automobiles. One of the automobiles used for that purpose was owned by Appellant. Her car was driven by Mr. Garst, the coach of the Soda Springs High School team.

Appellant knew the Soda Springs High School football team and the Paris High School football team were to play a game of football at Paris September 21, 1934; she volunteered her car for use in transporting some of the members of the Soda Springs team to and from the game; that she asked the coach, Russell Garst, the day before the game, if he had all the cars necessary for the trip to Paris the next day; that he said he needed one more; that she told him he might use her car if he drove it; that she was not promised compensation for the use of her car and did 2not receive any; that the school district paid for the gasoline used on the trip to and from the game; that she testified she loaned the car to Mr. Garst; that she had not employed Mr. Garst at any time and that she had not at any time “directed his work or his services, or what he was doing.”


### Rule of law:

“agency” indicates the relation which exists where one person acts for another. It has these three principal forms: 
1. The relation of principal and agent; 
2. The relation of master and servant; and, 
3. The relation of employer or proprietor and independent contractor. 
"Agency” is the relationship which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act. [Restatement of Agency § 1.]

### Issue:
Was the coach, Russell Garst, the agent of appellant while and in driving her car from Soda Springs to Paris, and in returning to the point where the accident occurred?

### Holding:
Yes. When the owner of a car authorizes an individual to drive that car for a specific purpose, the driver acts as an agent for the owner. No compensation or business association between the parties is necessary to create a principal-agent relationship. 


### Rationale:
In _Willi v. Schaefer Hitchcock Co._, 25 P. 2d 167 (1933), this court held that ownership of a car is enough to create a presumption that an individual who drives that car acts as an agent for the owner. Doty’s testimony confirms that she volunteered her car for the purpose of transporting football players to and from a game. Doty explicitly told Garst that he could use her car on the condition that Garst drive it, and Garst expressed his agreement by driving players to the game in Doty’s car. The jury correctly found that a principal-agent relationship existed between Doty and Garst at the time of the accident.


### Judgment:
judgments & orders affirmed with costs to respondents
