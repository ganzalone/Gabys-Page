### Procedural history:

### Facts:
Mill Street Church of Christ (Church) (defendant) regularly hired Bill Hogan to paint and maintain the church building over a period of time. The Church had routinely allowed Bill Hogan to hire his brother Sam Hogan (plaintiff) as an assistant on painting projects. In 1986, Church Elder Dr. Waggoner hired Bill Hogan again to paint the church. No mention of hiring a helper was made during the discussion between Dr. Waggoner and Bill Hogan. During his painting, Bill Hogan reached a point where he could not finish the job without an assistant. Bill Hogan approached Dr. Waggoner about hiring a helper. The parties agreed that a helper was necessary and discussed the possibility of hiring a Mr. Petty to assist, but Dr. Waggoner acknowledged that Mr. Petty was hard to reach. The next day, Bill Hogan offered Sam Hogan the helper job. After hearing the details of the position, Sam Hogan accepted the offer and commenced work. A half hour after he started work, Sam Hogan fell and sustained an injury that required hospitalization. Bill Hogan reported the accident to the Church treasurer, who paid Bill Hogan for hours spent on the project, including the half hour Sam Hogan worked. Sam Hogan filed a claim for workers’ compensation. The Old Workers’ Compensation Board (Old Board) ruled that Sam Hogan was not an employee of the Church and denied his compensation claim. The New Board reversed the Old Board’s ruling, concluding that Bill Hogan had implied authority as a Church agent to hire Sam Hogan, and that Sam Hogan was a Church employee entitled to compensation. The Church petitioned for review of the New Board’s decision.


### Rule of law:
Implied authority to act as an agent exists when it is shown that a principal acted in a manner that would lead an agent to reasonably believe that the principal intended for the agent to have such powers as are practically necessary to carry out the duties delegated.


### Issue:
Can implied authority be established by evidence showing a course of conduct between two parties which would lead an agent to reasonably believe that a principal intended the agent to have authority under the circumstances?


### Holding:
Yes. When a principal has routinely granted an agent certain powers, implied authority is assumed when the agent exercises those powers. Implied authority is proven circumstantially when it is shown that the principal intended the agent to have such authority as was necessary to perform the duties the principal assigned. 

### Rationale:
The Church had previously allowed Bill Hogan to hire Sam Hogan to assist in painting projects. In this case, Bill Hogan could not have finished his work without a helper, and Dr. Waggoner acknowledged that fact when he and Bill Hogan discussed the possibility of hiring an assistant and recognized that Mr. Petty would be hard to reach. Additionally, the Church paid Bill Hogan for the time Sam Hogan worked on the project. The evidence shows that the Church’s actions led Bill Hogan to reasonably believe that he had authority to hire Sam Hogan. Hence, Bill Hogan had implied authority to hire Sam Hogan. 


### Judgement:
Based on the evidence, this court finds that Sam Hogan was an employee of the Church at the time of the accident and affirms the New Board’s decision.
