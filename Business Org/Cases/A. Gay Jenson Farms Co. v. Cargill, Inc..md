##### 8/22/23, pg 7
*309 N.W.2d 285 (1981)*

Plaintiff(s): 86 farmers
Defendant(s): Cargill & Warren 

### Procedural history:
Plaintiffs bring action against defendant Cargill, Inc. (Cargill) and defendant Warren Grain & Seed Co. (Warren) to recover losses sustained when Warren defaulted on the contracts made with plaintiffs for the sale of grain. After a trial by jury, judgment was entered in favor of plaintiffs, and Cargill brought this appeal.

### Facts:

Warren Grain & Seed Co. (Warren), an agricultural company that operated a grain elevator, contracted with several local farmers (plaintiffs) to purchase grain for resale. In 1964, Warren sought financing for working capital from Cargill (defendant). The parties executed a security agreement by which Cargill would loan money to Warren on “open account” financing with a limit of $175,000, and Warren would receive funds and pay expenses through drafts drawn on Cargill through Minneapolis banks. The drafts were imprinted with Warren’s and Cargill’s names. In exchange for the financing, Cargill became Warren’s grain agent, and Cargill was given right of first refusal to buy grain sold by Warren. In 1967, the parties executed a new contract which increased Warren’s credit line and gave Cargill authority over some of Warren’s internal operations, including requiring Warren to give Cargill annual financial statements, granting Cargill access to Warren’s books, and requiring Cargill’s approval before engaging in certain financial transactions. Cargill exercised its contractual authority and commenced a pattern of reviewing Warren’s finances and operations and making business recommendations to Warren. By the mid-1970s, Warren was shipping 90% of its grain to Cargill. Cargill later discovered that Warren was engaging in some questionable uses of funds, but instead of calling the loan, Cargill executed new security agreements with Warren, increasing its limit to $1,250,000. Warren’s debt later exceeded its credit line and Cargill became increasingly involved with Warren’s finances, including keeping daily debit positions and opening a bank account in Warren’s name, funded by drafts drawn on Cargill through a local bank. Warren subsequently went bankrupt. The farmers who sold grain to Warren sued Cargill for recovery of $2 million, alleging that Cargill had acted as principal for the grain elevator and was thus liable for its agent Warren’s contractual obligations. At trial, the jury found in favor of the farmers.


### Rule of law:
A principal-agent relationship exists between a creditor and debtor when the creditor intervenes in the business affairs of the debtor.


### Issue:
Is a creditor liable as a principal for the contracts of a debtor when the creditor takes control of the debtor’s business functions?

### Holding:
Yes. When a creditor *exerts ACTIVE control over the operations of a debtor*, a principal-agent relationship is created between the parties, and the creditor is liable for the contractual obligations of the debtor. 

### Rationale:
Cargill consented that Warren would be its agent when Cargill made its operational recommendations to Warren. Warren consented to be Cargill’s agent when it obtained grain for Cargill under the operations financed by Cargill. Moreover, Cargill’s influencing Warren’s internal affairs, particularly its finances, demonstrates control over the grain elevator. Cargill contends that its business dealings with Warren were nothing more than that of a typical creditor-debtor relationship. But, the record shows that the main purpose of Cargill’s financing of Warren was to obtain a source of grain for its business, not to make money from its loans to Warren. Cargill kept purchasing grain from Warren while increasing its financing of Warren, even when it became apparent that Warren was becoming a great financial risk. Cargill also asserts that its relationship with Warren was that of a buyer-supplier, not a principal-agent. However, in order for two businesses to have a strict buyer-supplier relationship, they must be independent businesses. In this instance, Warren’s operations were financed by Cargill, Cargill established control over Warren’s operations, and Warren sold nearly all of its grain to Cargill. Hence, Warren’s business was not independent from Cargill’s. 


### Judgement:
District court decision affirmed.
