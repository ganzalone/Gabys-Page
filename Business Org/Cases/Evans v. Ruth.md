### Procedural history:

### Facts:
A foreman hired James S. Evans (plaintiff) to work at a stone quarry. Homer Ruth (defendant) owned the company performing the work. Documentation of each load of stone was made, with Ruth and Evans each receiving a copy. When Evans presented his bill to Ruth, Ruth acknowledged that Evans had completed the work and promised to pay him. Ruth did not pay Evans and later offered to pay 53 percent of the amount owed, which Evans refused. Ruth denied any contractual obligations to Evans, alleging that his independent subcontractor, George Darr, was responsible for nearly the entire job. Evans brought an action in assumpsit to recover money owed for his work. Evans received a judgment in his favor in the lower court. Ruth appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court.

### Rule of law:
A principal is bound by the unauthorized act of an agent if the principal ratifies such act through affirmation.

### Issue:
Is a principal bound by the unauthorized act of an agent if the principal ratifies such act through affirmation?

### Holding:
Yes. A principal is bound by the unauthorized act of an agent if the principal ratifies the act through affirmation. A principal can ratify conduct of its agent through an express or implied affirmation of the conduct. For implied ratification, the principal must have knowledge of the contract and must not reject its benefits. A principal must not benefit from the conduct of its agent and avoid liability merely because the conduct was not authorized at the time the transaction occurs. If a benefit is derived from unauthorized conduct of an agent, it is fair for the principal to compensate the third party for such benefit.

### Rationale:
In this case, Evans performed work under the direction of an unidentified foreman who appeared to possess the appropriate authority to hire employees for the stone work. Ruth, by his own words, expressly affirmed his obligation under contract to compensate Evans for the work he performed. Although Evans did not know Darr was a subcontractor rather than the general contractor who was ultimately responsible for payment, the fact that Ruth ratified the contract is enough to create liability.

### Judgement:
Therefore, Ruth is bound by the contract between Darr and Evans. The court finds no error in the record.
