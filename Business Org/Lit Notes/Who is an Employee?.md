Restatement (3d) § 7.07(3):  
“For purposes of this section,  
(a) an employee is an agent whose principal  
controls or has the right to control the manner  
and means of the agent's performance of work,  
and (b) the fact that work is performed  
gratuitously does not relieve a principal of  
liability.”
