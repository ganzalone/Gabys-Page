## Wrongful Dissolution

• UPA does not expressly define the term wrongful dissolution.  
• Instead, § 38(2) refers to a dissolution “caused in contravention of the partnership agreement” and thereafter sets out the consequences of having “dissolved wrongfully.”  
• Wrongfully dissolving partner does not get value of good will.


### Actual Authority of Partners to Bind Partnership upon Dissolution (UPA § 33, 35)  

General rule: dissolution terminates all actual authority of all partners to transact  
business on behalf of the partnership  

Exception: Authority to conduct business  
necessary to wind up the partnership

As to creditor that has done business with the partnership prior to dissolution, partner has apparent authority to bind the partnership post- dissolution UNLESS creditor knew or had notice of dissolution.  

As to all other third parties, apparent  
authority may be destroyed by advertising dissolution in newspaper of general circulation in place where partnership business is regularly carried on.
