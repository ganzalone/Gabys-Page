UPA § 18 (h): 
“Any difference arising as to ordinary matters connected with the partnership business may be decided by a majority of the partners...”


UPA § 9(1) - Apparent Authority  
Every partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business, and the act of every partner,... for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the partnership... binds the partnership, unless the partner so acting has in fact no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter, and the person with whom he is dealing has knowledge of the fact that he has no such authority.

UPA § 9(2) Actual / Apparent Authority  
An act of a partner which is not apparently for the carrying on of the business of the partnership in the usual way does not bind the partnership unless authorized by the other partners.
