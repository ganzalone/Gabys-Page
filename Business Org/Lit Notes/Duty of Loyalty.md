UPA § 21(1)  
Every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him  
without the consent of the other partners  
from any transaction connected with the  
formation, conduct, or liquidation of the  
partnership or from any use by him of its  
property.

# Waiver of Duty of Loyalty  
• UPA: silent; unclear to what extent duty may be waived by partners  

• RUPA § 103(b): partnership agreement may not eliminate the duty of loyalty entirely  BUT may identify specific types or  
categories of activities that do not violate  
duty of loyalty SO LONG AS not “manifestly  
unreasonable.”
